Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's 7 disks, which is an odd number, I remember from the search results that the iterative solution involves moving the smallest disk in a specific pattern. 

First, the minimum number of moves required is 2^7 - 1, which is 127 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list. The iterative approach mentioned in the sources alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For an odd number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a circular pattern: right if even, left if odd. Wait, 7 is odd, so the smallest disk should move to the left each time. But I need to confirm the exact pattern.

Looking at the example with 3 disks, the solution involved moving disk 1 first. The iterative solution steps mentioned moving the smallest piece alternately with the next available move. Each time, after moving the smallest, there's only one legal move for the non-smallest disk. 

I need to generate each move step by step. Let's start:

Move 1: Disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Now peg0 has 7,6,5,4,3,2; peg2 has 1.

Move 2: Now, the next non-smallest move. The next disk to move is 2. It can go from peg0 to peg1. So move 2 from 0 to 1.

Move 3: Move disk 1 from peg2 to peg1. Now peg1 has 2,1.

Move 4: Move disk 3 from peg0 to peg2.

Move 5: Move disk 1 from peg1 to peg0.

Move 6: Move disk 2 from peg1 to peg2.

Move 7: Move disk 1 from peg0 to peg2. Now peg2 has 3,2,1.

This pattern continues, alternating between moving disk 1 and the next available disk. Each time, after moving a larger disk, we have to rebuild the smaller tower on top of it. 

But with 7 disks, this process repeats recursively. Each time a larger disk is moved, the smaller disks need to be transferred using the same pattern. Since this is time-consuming, I need to ensure each move follows the rules and that no larger disk is placed on a smaller one.

Wait, the example in the search results for 7 disks might have a specific sequence. Let me check the sources. Source [2] mentions steps for a seven-disk puzzle, but the exact moves aren't listed. The iterative solution from source [3] says to alternate moves between the smallest and non-smallest, with the direction depending on the parity. Since 7 is odd, the smallest disk moves left each time. So the sequence would be: move disk 1 left (from 0 to 2, then 2 to 1, then 1 to 0, etc.), then move the next available disk, and repeat.

But generating all 127 moves manually is error-prone. However, the user insists on the full list. Let's try to outline the pattern systematically.

The standard iterative solution for Tower of Hanoi with an odd number of disks involves the following steps in a loop:

1. Move the smallest disk (1) one peg to the left (if odd) or right (if even). Since 7 is odd, move left (from 0 to 2, then 2 to 1, then 1 to 0, etc.).
2. Make the only valid move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.
3. Repeat until all disks are on the target peg.

Applying this, each cycle involves moving disk 1 left, then moving the next possible disk. Let's try to generate the first few moves and see the pattern:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move 1 from 0 to 2
8. Move 4 from 0 to 1
9. Move 1 from 2 to 1
10. Move 2 from 2 to 0
11. Move 1 from 1 to 0
12. Move 3 from 2 to 1
13. Move 1 from 0 to 2
14. Move 2 from 0 to 1
15. Move 1 from 2 to 1
16. Move 5 from 0 to 2
... and so on.

This pattern continues, with each even-numbered disk moving every 2^(n-1) steps. For 7 disks, the largest disk (7) will move once, at move 64 (since 2^(7-1) = 64). 

But to generate all 127 moves correctly, I need to ensure each move follows the rules. Since manually listing all 127 is tedious, perhaps there's a recursive way to generate the moves. However, the user wants the iterative approach. 

Alternatively, using the recursive approach, the steps would involve:

- Move n-1 disks from peg0 to peg1 using peg2 as auxiliary.
- Move disk n from peg0 to peg2.
- Move n-1 disks from peg1 to peg2 using peg0 as auxiliary.

But for 7 disks, this would generate the correct sequence. However, the iterative method is more straightforward for coding the moves without recursion.

Given the complexity, I'll proceed to generate the moves step by step, ensuring each move is valid and adheres to the rules. Each time, after moving the smallest disk, the next move is the only possible legal move with the remaining disks.

Let me start listing the moves systematically, checking each step:

Now, the largest disk is on peg2. The remaining task is to move the 6 disks from peg1 to peg2. This follows the same pattern but with the source peg as 1, target as 2, and auxiliary as 0.

    Peg2: 7,4,3,2

79. Move 1 from 0 to 2
    Peg2: 7,4,3,2,1

80. Move 5 from 1 to 0
    Peg0: 5
    Peg1: 6

81. Move 1 from 2 to 1
    Peg1: 6,1

82. Move 2 from 2 to 0
    Peg0: 5,2

83. Move 1 from 1 to 0
    Peg0: 5,2,1

    Peg1: 6,3

85. Move 1 from 0 to 2
    Peg2: 7,4,3,1

86. Move 2 from 0 to 1
    Peg1: 6,3,2

87. Move 1 from 2 to 1
    Peg1: 6,3,2,1

88. Move 4 from 2 to 0
    Peg0: 5,4
    Peg2: 7

89. Move 1 from 1 to 0
    Peg0: 5,4,1

90. Move 2 from 1 to 2
    Peg2: 7,2

91. Move 1 from 0 to 2
    Peg2: 7,2,1

92. Move 3 from 1 to 0
    Peg0: 5,4,3

93. Move 1 from 2 to 1
    Peg1: 6,1

94. Move 2 from 2 to 0
    Peg0: 5,4,3,2

95. Move 1 from 1 to 0
    Peg0: 5,4,3,2,1

96. Move 5 from 0 to 2
    Peg0: empty
    Peg2: 7,5

97. Move 1 from 0 to 2
    Peg2: 7,5,1

Wait, but peg0 is empty here. Wait, after move 96, peg0 has 5,4,3,2,1 moved to peg2? No, move 96 is moving disk 5 from peg0 to peg2. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the sequence. Let me retrace.

After move 88: peg0 has 5,4; peg2 has 7. Then move 89: move 1 from peg1 (which has 6,3,2,1) to peg0. So peg0 becomes 5,4,1. Then move 90: move 2 from peg1 (now 6,3,2) to peg2. Peg2 becomes 7,2. Then move 91: move 1 from peg0 to peg2, making peg2:7,2,1. Then move 92: move 3 from peg1 (6,3) to peg0. Peg0:5,4,3. Peg1:6. Then move 93: move 1 from peg2 (7,2,1) to peg1. Peg1:6,1. Move 94: move 2 from peg2 (7,2) to peg0. Peg0:5,4,3,2. Move 95: move 1 from peg1 (6,1) to peg0. Peg0:5,4,3,2,1. Move 96: move 5 from peg0 (5,4,3,2,1) to peg2. But wait, the top disk on peg0 is 1, so we can't move 5. This indicates an error in the sequence. 

Ah, here's a mistake. After move 95, peg0 has disks 5,4,3,2,1. The top disk is 1, so the next move should involve moving disk 1, not disk 5. This suggests an error in the previous steps. This means the iterative approach requires careful tracking. 

This highlights the complexity of manually generating all 127 moves. To avoid errors, perhaps a better approach is to follow the recursive method, which ensures correctness. The recursive solution for moving n disks from source to target using auxiliary is:

1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using target.
2. Move nth disk from source to target.
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target using source.

Applying this recursively for 7 disks:

- Move 6 disks from peg0 to peg1 using peg2.
- Move disk7 from peg0 to peg2.
- Move 6 disks from peg1 to peg2 using peg0.

Each of these steps breaks down into smaller moves. For example, moving 6 disks requires moving 5 disks first, and so on. This recursive breakdown ensures each move is valid. 

However, translating this into the iterative list of 127 moves is challenging without a programmatic approach. Given the user's requirement for the complete list and the risk of manual errors, I need to ensure each move is correctly generated. 

Alternatively, referring to the search results, source [1] is a video solution for 7 disks. While I can't watch the video, the description mentions it's the simplest and most optimum solution. Source [2] provides a step-by-step for seven disks, mentioning moving disk 1 left initially. 

Following the steps from source [2]:

Step 1: Move Disk 1 to the left (from peg0 to peg2).
Step 2: Move Disk 2.
Step 3: Move Disk 1 to the left (from peg2 to peg1).
Step 4: Move Disk 3.
... and so on, alternating between moving disk 1 and the next disk.

This pattern continues, with each even step moving a larger disk. The exact sequence would follow this alternating pattern, ensuring that after each larger disk move, the smaller disks are repositioned correctly.

Given the complexity and to ensure accuracy, I'll proceed to list all 127 moves following the iterative approach, carefully checking each step's validity. Each move of disk 1 alternates direction (left for odd n), and the non-disk1 moves are the only legal option available.
