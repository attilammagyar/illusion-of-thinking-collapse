Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 8 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's 8 disks, which is an even number, I remember that the iterative solution might involve moving the smallest disk in a specific pattern. 

First, the minimum number of moves required is 2^8 - 1, which is 255. That's a lot of moves, but the user insists on the full list. The challenge is generating all 255 moves correctly without missing any steps.

Looking at the search results, the iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific direction each time. The example given for 3 disks had a specific pattern, and the solution for 8 disks would follow a similar logic but scaled up.

I need to make sure each move adheres to the rules: only moving the top disk of a peg, and never placing a larger disk on a smaller one. The recursive approach might be easier to model, but generating the iterative steps programmatically is tricky. However, since the user wants the exact sequence, perhaps there's a pattern to follow.

From the chessandpoker.com source (result 5), they mention an algorithm where for each step, you move the smallest disk in a direction (left or right) and then make the only possible move with the next available disk. For even-numbered disks, the initial direction for the smallest disk is to the right. So, starting with peg 0, the first move would be disk 1 to peg 1 (since moving right from peg 0 would be peg 1, then peg 2, then wrap around if needed).

Wait, the example in the problem statement for 3 disks used moves like [1,0,2], which is disk 1 from peg 0 to 2. But 3 is odd, so the direction might be different. For 8 disks (even), the smallest disk should move to the right each time. So the sequence would be: move disk 1 to peg 1, then the next possible non-smallest disk, then disk 1 to peg 2, and so on, alternating between moving the smallest and the next possible disk.

But how to translate this into the exact sequence of 255 moves? Manually listing each step isn't feasible. Instead, I need to find a pattern or algorithm that can generate all the moves correctly. The recursive approach splits the problem into moving n-1 disks, then the nth disk, then n-1 again. For 8 disks, this would involve moving 7 disks to peg 1, then disk 8 to peg 2, then 7 disks from peg 1 to peg 2. But recursively, each of those 7-disk moves would break down further.

However, the user wants the iterative solution's move list. The iterative method for even n involves moving the smallest disk in a specific direction each time and then making the only legal move with another disk. Let's outline the steps:

1. Initialize the direction for the smallest disk (even n: right, so peg 0 → 1 → 2 → 0...).
2. While not all disks are on peg 2:
   a. Move the smallest disk (disk 1) in the current direction.
   b. Make the only possible legal move with the remaining disks (not involving disk 1).
   c. Repeat.

Each time after moving disk 1, there's only one valid move for the next disk. This alternation continues until completion.

But to generate each move step-by-step, I need to simulate this process. Let's try to outline the first few moves and see the pattern:

Move 1: Disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (smallest move right)
Move 2: Disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (only legal move not involving disk 1)
Move 3: Disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2 (smallest move right again)
Move 4: Disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1 (next available move)
Move 5: Disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0 (since after moving disk 3, the next smallest move is to the right from peg 2, which wraps to peg 0)
Move 6: Disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1
Move 7: Disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
Move 8: Disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2
... and so on.

This pattern continues, with the smallest disk moving right each time, and the other moves following the only legal option. Each time a larger disk is moved, it's placed on an empty peg or on a larger disk.

To generate all 255 moves, I need to implement this algorithm step by step. However, since I can't actually run code here, I have to rely on known patterns or existing solutions. The search results mention that the solution for 8 disks requires 255 moves (result 3), and the YouTube videos (results 1 and 2) show the solution, but the exact move list isn't provided in the search snippets.

Given that the example for 3 disks had a specific sequence, perhaps the 8-disk solution follows a similar recursive pattern. The recursive approach for n disks involves:

1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary peg.
2. Move nth disk from source to target.
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target.

For 8 disks, the first step is moving 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary. Then move disk 8 to peg 2. Then move the 7 disks from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary. Each of these steps would recursively break down into smaller problems.

But translating this recursion into the exact move list is complex. Each recursive call would generate a sequence of moves. For example, moving 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 would require 127 moves (2^7 -1), then the 128th move is disk 8 to peg 2, then another 127 moves to transfer the 7 disks to peg 2, totaling 255.

However, the exact sequence of disk movements for each recursive step would need to be tracked. Since the user wants the full list, I need to ensure that each move is correctly ordered. 

Alternatively, the iterative approach's move sequence can be determined by the binary representation of the move numbers. Each move corresponds to a bit in the binary count from 1 to 2^n -1. The position of the least significant zero bit determines which disk to move. But I'm not sure about the exact mapping here.

Another approach is to note that for each disk, the number of times it's moved is 2^(8 - k), where k is the disk number (1 to 8). Disk 1 moves every other move, disk 2 every four moves, etc. But again, generating the exact sequence requires knowing the order.

Given the complexity, perhaps the best way is to rely on the known optimal solution for 8 disks, which is a sequence of 255 moves following the recursive pattern. Since the search results confirm that 255 moves are needed (result 3), and the example for 3 disks follows the recursive method, it's safe to assume that the correct move list is generated by the recursive algorithm.

Therefore, the move sequence would be the one generated by the recursive solution, which for 8 disks would involve moving the top 7 disks back and forth between pegs as needed. Each move can be determined by following the recursive steps, but enumerating all 255 moves manually is impractical. However, since the user requires the full list, I must provide it.

But wait, the user provided an example for 3 disks with a specific move list. Let's compare that to the standard recursive solution. For 3 disks, the standard recursive solution has 7 moves:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move 1 from 0 to 2

Which matches the example's moves except the example's moves are in a different order. Wait, the example provided in the problem statement for 3 disks has the moves:

[[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2]]

Which corresponds to the standard solution. So the example follows the recursive approach. Therefore, the 8-disk solution would follow the same recursive pattern, leading to 255 moves.

Generating the exact list programmatically would require implementing the recursive algorithm, but since I can't do that here, I need to either recall the pattern or find a way to describe it. However, the user insists on the full list, so I must provide it.

Given that the search results don't provide the exact move list, but confirm the number of moves, I'll have to construct the move list based on the recursive method. Each move can be determined by the recursive steps, but detailing all 255 moves here is beyond manual capacity. However, perhaps there's a pattern or formula to generate each move.

Alternatively, the iterative approach's moves can be determined by the following rules:

- For even n, the smallest disk moves clockwise (0 → 1 → 2 → 0...)
- For odd n, it moves counterclockwise (0 → 2 → 1 → 0...)

Since 8 is even, the smallest disk moves clockwise. Each move of the smallest disk is followed by the only possible legal move with another disk.

Following this, the sequence alternates between moving disk 1 and another disk. Let's attempt to generate the first few moves:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 1 (smallest disk clockwise)
2. Move 2 from 0 to 2 (only legal move)
3. Move 1 from 1 to 2 (smallest disk clockwise)
4. Move 3 from 0 to 1 (only legal move)
5. Move 1 from 2 to 0 (smallest disk clockwise, since 2 → 0 is next in clockwise after 2)
6. Move 2 from 2 to 1 (only legal move)
7. Move 1 from 0 to 1 (smallest disk clockwise)
8. Move 4 from 0 to 2 (only legal move)
... and so on.

This pattern continues, with each even step moving a larger disk, and odd steps moving disk 1. Each time a larger disk is moved, it's placed on an empty peg or a larger disk. This iterative approach should generate the correct sequence.

However, manually listing all 255 steps is impractical. But since the user requires it, I must provide the complete list. Given that the search results don't include the exact sequence, I'll have to rely on the recursive solution's structure, ensuring that each move follows the rules.

The recursive solution for n disks can be represented as follows:

- To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:
  1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using target.
  2. Move disk n from source to target.
  3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target using source.

Applying this recursively for 8 disks:

1. Move 7 disks from 0 to 1 using 2.
2. Move disk 8 from 0 to 2.
3. Move 7 disks from 1 to 2 using 0.

Each of these steps breaks down further. For example, moving 7 disks from 0 to 1 requires:

1. Move 6 disks from 0 to 2 using 1.
2. Move disk 7 from 0 to 1.
3. Move 6 disks from 2 to 1 using 0.

This recursion continues until reaching the base case of moving disk 1.

The exact sequence of moves can be generated by following this recursion. Each time a disk is moved, it's recorded in the move list. For 8 disks, this results in 255 moves. 

Since the user example for 3 disks follows this recursive approach, the 8-disk solution will follow the same pattern but with more steps. Therefore, the move list will be the recursive solution's output.

However, without the actual list, I need to generate it here. Given the constraints, I'll proceed to list all 255 moves by simulating the recursive approach. Each move will be determined by the recursive steps, ensuring that no invalid moves are made.

But given the length, I'll need to ensure that the list is accurate. Let's start building the move list step by step for 8 disks using the recursive method.

The recursive function would look like this:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

Applying this for n=8, source=0, target=2, auxiliary=1.

The first call is hanoi(8,0,2,1). This breaks down into:

hanoi(7,0,1,2) → which then breaks down further, and so on.

Each recursive call generates the moves for smaller n. The base case is when n=1, which appends the move of disk 1.

Following this recursion, the moves for 8 disks would be generated in the correct order. However, manually tracing this recursion for 8 disks is time-consuming, but since the user requires it, I'll proceed.

The resulting move list will have 255 entries, each following the recursive pattern. Each move of a larger disk is preceded and followed by the necessary moves of smaller disks to free up the larger disk.

For example, the first few moves for 8 disks would involve moving the top 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, which itself is a complex sequence of 127 moves. Then move disk 8 from peg 0 to peg 2, and then move the 7 disks from peg 1 to peg 2, another 127 moves.

The exact sequence is lengthy, but the recursive approach ensures that each move is valid. Therefore, the final move list is the one generated by this recursive algorithm.
