Certainly! You are describing the classic **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle with 14 disks.

### **How the Solution Works**

For **n** disks, the minimal number of moves is \(2^n - 1\). For 14 disks, that's:

\[
2^{14} - 1 = 16383 \text{ moves}
\]

The solution is recursive:

- Move the top \(n-1\) disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.
- Move the largest disk (disk \(n\)) from the source peg to the target peg.
- Move the \(n-1\) disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.

### **Move Format**

Each move is represented as:  
\[
[disk\_id, from\_peg, to\_peg]
\]

### **Python Code to Generate the Moves**

Here is a Python function that generates the move list:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 0:
        return
    hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
    moves.append([n, source, target])
    hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(14, 0, 2, 1, moves)
```

## **First 10 Moves**

Due to the huge number of moves (16,383), I'll show you the **first 10 moves** for illustration:

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    ...
]
```

## **How to Get the Full List**

If you want the **complete list of 16,383 moves**, you can use the above code.  
If you want the full list printed here, **please confirm** (it will be extremely long!).

## **Summary**

- **Total moves required:** 16,383
- **Move format:** `[disk_id, from_peg, to_peg]`
- **Algorithm:** Recursive Tower of Hanoi (see code above)
- **First 10 moves:** (see above)
