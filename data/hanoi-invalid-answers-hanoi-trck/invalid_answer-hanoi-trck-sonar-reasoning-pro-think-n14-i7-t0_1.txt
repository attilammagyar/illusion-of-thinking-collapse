Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 14 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since there are 14 disks, which is an even number, I remember from the search results that the iterative solution might involve moving the smallest disk in a specific direction each time. 

First, the minimum number of moves required is 2^14 - 1, which is 16383 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list. The challenge is generating this without truncation, even if it's lengthy.

Looking at the iterative solution mentioned in source [2], for an even number of disks, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move in a consistent direction, probably to the right. The steps alternate between moving the smallest disk and making the only legal move with another disk. 

But how to translate this into a sequence of moves? Each move must be recorded with the from_peg, to_peg, and the state of each peg after the move. Starting with peg 0 full and pegs 1 and 2 empty.

The example for 3 disks in the user's note shows a specific pattern. For 14 disks, the process would follow a similar recursive pattern but iteratively. However, generating each step manually isn't feasible. Instead, I need to apply the algorithm systematically.

From source [2], the iterative solution steps are:
1. Move the smallest disk to the next peg in the direction (right for even n).
2. Make the only legal move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

Repeating these steps until all disks are on peg 2. Since the user provided an example with error correction, the move_id can be corrected if needed, but ideally, the initial list should be accurate.

But generating all 16383 moves here is impractical due to token limits. However, the user insists on the complete list, so perhaps the answer must attempt it, even if truncated by the system. But the assistant should try to output as much as possible.

Wait, the user's note says not to truncate and to output the entire list even if it's long. So the assistant must generate all moves. But given the context, maybe the assistant can't actually list all 16k moves. However, the problem might expect the assistant to recognize that it's impossible to output all moves here and instead provide the correct approach or the first few and last moves, but the user explicitly says not to truncate. 

But according to the personalization section, the assistant must output the complete list, even if it's long. So perhaps the assistant should proceed to generate the moves step by step, following the iterative algorithm, and output them in the specified format. However, given the token limitations, it's impossible to output all 16k moves. This is a contradiction. 

Wait, the user is aware of the token limit and says, "This is a benchmark test where the first invalid move you generate matters... Truncating the list in any way risks a low score." So the assistant must output as much as possible of the correct sequence, even if it's cut off. Therefore, the correct approach is to generate the moves according to the iterative solution, starting with move 1, and continue until the output is truncated.

But how to structure this? The iterative solution for even n (14) would have the smallest disk moving right (0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0...) and the other moves determined by legality. Let's start generating the moves:

Move 1: Disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (since n is even, first move is to the right). But wait, in the example for 3 disks (odd), the first move was to peg 2. According to source [2], for even n, the smallest moves to the right (peg 1 first), then peg 2, etc. Wait, the direction depends on the number of disks. For even, the smallest moves to the right (0->1->2->0...), for odd, to the left (0->2->1->0...). 

So for 14 disks (even), the first move is disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1. Then the next move is the only legal move not involving disk 1, which would be disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2. Then move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2. Then move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1. Then disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0, disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1, disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.

But generating each of these steps in the required format is time-consuming. However, the assistant must try to output them correctly. Let's attempt the first few moves:

1,0,1,14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2,1,
2,0,2,14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3,1,2
3,1,2,14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3, ,2 1
4,0,1,14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4,3,2 1
5,2,0,14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 1,3,2
6,2,1,14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 1,3 2,
7,0,1,14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4,3 2 1,
...

But this is tedious. The correct approach is to follow the iterative algorithm, alternating between moving the smallest disk and the only possible non-smallest disk. Each time, the smallest disk moves in the direction determined by the evenness of n. For 14, it's right (0->1->2->0...). The non-smallest move is determined by the legal move between the other two pegs.

However, generating all 16383 moves here is impossible. The assistant must proceed to output the moves in the correct order, following the algorithm, until the response is cut off. The user understands that the list is long but requires the assistant to output as much as possible without truncating intentionally.

Therefore, the assistant will start generating the moves step by step, following the iterative solution for even n, ensuring each move is correctly formatted with the peg states after each move. The assistant will continue this process until the output limit is reached, adhering strictly to the format specified.
