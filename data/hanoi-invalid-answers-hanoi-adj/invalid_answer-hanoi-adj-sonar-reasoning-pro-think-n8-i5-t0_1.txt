Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 8 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's 8 disks, which is an even number, I remember from the search results that the iterative solution might involve moving the smallest disk in a specific direction each time. 

First, the minimum number of moves required is 2^8 - 1, which is 255. That's a lot of moves, but the user insists on the full list. The iterative approach mentioned in the sources alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For even-numbered disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern, maybe to the right each time. 

Looking at the example given for 3 disks, the moves start with moving disk 1 from 0 to 2. Then disk 2 from 0 to 1, and so on. The pattern seems to follow a recursive structure, but since we need an iterative solution, I'll have to generate each step methodically.

Each move of the smallest disk (disk 1) alternates direction. For even n, the initial direction is to the right. So disk 1 moves 0→2→1→0→2... and so on. After each move of disk 1, the next move is the only legal move possible with the remaining disks. 

I need to simulate this process step by step. Let's start:

1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2. Now peg 2 has disk 1.
2. The next move is the smallest possible disk that's not 1. The only option is disk 2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1.
3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1. Now peg 1 has disks 1 and 2.
4. Next, move disk 3 from 0 to 2.
5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0.
6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2.
7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2.
8. Move disk 4 from 0 to 1.
... and this pattern continues, alternating between moving the smallest disk and the next available disk.

This process repeats, with each even step moving a larger disk, and the odd steps moving disk 1 in the prescribed direction. Since there are 255 moves, I need to generate each one systematically. 

But manually listing all 255 moves is error-prone. Instead, I can use the recursive approach's insight but implement it iteratively. The recursive solution for moving n disks from source to target using an auxiliary peg involves:

- Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.
- Move nth disk from source to target.
- Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target.

But since the user wants an iterative solution, perhaps the pattern from the search results' iterative method is better. The iterative solution for even n (8) would have the smallest disk moving in a cycle: 0→2→1→0→2→1..., and each non-smallest disk move is determined by the only legal option.

Alternatively, the iterative approach can be structured as follows for even n:

- For each move number m from 1 to 255:
   - If m is odd, move the smallest disk (disk 1) in the current direction (right for even n).
   - If m is even, determine which disk to move next by finding the largest possible disk that can be moved, which isn't the same as the last moved disk.

But generating each move requires tracking the state of the pegs after each move. This is complex, but perhaps there's a pattern in the moves. For example, the moves for 3 disks are:

[[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2]]

Which follows the pattern of moving disk 1 alternately, then the next available disk. For 8 disks, the same pattern would extend, but with more layers.

Another approach is to note that each disk moves in a cycle. For even-numbered disks, the order is 0→1→2→0..., and for odd-numbered disks, it's 0→2→1→0... But disk 1 is the smallest and moves every other step. 

Alternatively, using the binary representation of the move numbers might help. Each move corresponds to a bit in binary, but I'm not sure. 

Given the complexity, perhaps the most reliable way is to use the recursive algorithm to generate the moves. The recursive function would generate the sequence by breaking down the problem into moving n-1 disks, then the nth disk, then n-1 again. For 8 disks, this would generate the correct sequence.

Let's outline the recursive approach for 8 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1 as auxiliary:

1. Move 7 disks from 0 to 1 using 2 as auxiliary.
2. Move disk 8 from 0 to 2.
3. Move 7 disks from 1 to 2 using 0 as auxiliary.

Each of these steps would themselves be broken down recursively. For example, moving 7 disks from 0 to 1 requires moving 6 disks from 0 to 2, then disk 7 to 1, then 6 disks from 2 to 1. This recursion continues until we reach the base case of moving disk 1.

The challenge is to translate this recursive approach into the sequence of moves. Each recursive call would generate a list of moves. For 8 disks, the total moves are 255, so the list will be long. 

Let's attempt to generate the first few moves using recursion:

- To move 8 disks from 0→2:
   - Move 7 disks from 0→1 using 2:
      - Move 6 disks from 0→2 using 1:
         - ... (this continues recursively)
   - Move disk 8 from 0→2.
   - Move 7 disks from 1→2 using 0.

The first move in the sequence would be the first move of the 7-disk transfer, which involves moving disk 1 from 0→2. Then the next moves follow the recursive pattern.

However, generating all 255 moves manually is impractical. Instead, I can use the known optimal sequence for the Tower of Hanoi, which follows the recursive pattern. Each disk's moves are spaced in powers of two. For example, disk 1 moves every other move, disk 2 every four moves, etc.

Another way to generate the moves is using the iterative algorithm described in the sources. For an even number of disks:

1. Make the legal move between pegs A and B (in either direction).
2. Make the legal move between pegs A and C (in either direction).
3. Make the legal move between pegs B and C (in either direction).
4. Repeat until all disks are on peg C.

But this might not directly apply. Alternatively, the iterative solution for even n involves moving the smallest disk in a specific direction each time and then making the only possible move with the larger disk.

Given the complexity, the most reliable method is to use the recursive approach to generate the moves. Let's outline the steps for 8 disks:

The recursive function hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary) generates moves to transfer n disks from source to target using auxiliary. The base case is n=1, which is a single move. For n>1:

hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
move disk n from source to target
hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

Applying this to n=8:

hanoi(8, 0, 2, 1)

Which breaks down into:

hanoi(7, 0, 1, 2)
move disk 8 from 0 to 2
hanoi(7, 1, 2, 0)

Each hanoi(7, ...) call further breaks down into moving 6 disks, etc., until reaching the base case.

Each time a disk is moved, it's added to the moves list. For example, the first move is moving disk 1 from 0 to 2, then disk 2 from 0 to 1, then disk 1 from 2 to 1, and so on.

The challenge is to generate all these moves correctly. Since the user requires the complete list, I need to ensure that each move is correctly ordered. Given that the example for 3 disks has 7 moves, and 8 disks require 255, the pattern must be followed precisely.

To avoid errors, perhaps referencing the known optimal sequence for 8 disks is necessary. However, without a precomputed list, I'll have to rely on the recursive algorithm's structure.

Let's attempt to generate the first few moves:

1. Move 1 from 0→2
2. Move 2 from 0→1
3. Move 1 from 2→1
4. Move 3 from 0→2
5. Move 1 from 1→0
6. Move 2 from 1→2
7. Move 1 from 0→2
8. Move 4 from 0→1
9. Move 1 from 2→1
10. Move 2 from 2→0
11. Move 1 from 1→0
12. Move 3 from 2→1
13. Move 1 from 0→2
14. Move 2 from 0→1
15. Move 1 from 2→1
16. Move 5 from 0→2
...

This pattern continues, with each even step moving a larger disk and the odd steps moving disk 1 in the prescribed direction. However, manually listing all 255 steps is impractical. Instead, the correct approach is to implement the recursive algorithm programmatically, but since I can't execute code, I must rely on the known structure.

The final answer must be the complete list of 255 moves in the specified format. Given the example for 3 disks, the moves follow the recursive pattern, and for 8 disks, the same logic applies but with more layers. Each move can be generated by following the recursive steps, ensuring that each disk's movement adheres to the rules.
