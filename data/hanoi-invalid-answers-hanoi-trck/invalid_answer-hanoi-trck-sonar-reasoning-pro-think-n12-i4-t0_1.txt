Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 12 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation. First, I remember that the minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, so for 12 disks, that's 4095 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

The standard recursive solution involves moving the top n-1 disks to an intermediate peg, then moving the largest disk to the target peg, and then moving the n-1 disks onto the largest one. But generating all those moves step-by-step manually would be impossible. However, there's an iterative approach mentioned in the sources. The iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only legal move possible with the remaining disks.

For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern: right, left, right, etc. Each move of the smallest disk is followed by the only possible move that doesn't involve the smallest disk. This pattern repeats until all disks are on the target peg.

But how to translate this into a sequence of moves for 12 disks? Each move needs to be recorded with the from_peg and to_peg. Since 12 is even, the smallest disk (1) should move right each time. So starting from peg 0, it goes to peg 1, then peg 2, then peg 0, and so on. After each move of disk 1, the next move is the only legal one between the other two pegs.

But keeping track of 4095 moves manually is error-prone. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to generate the moves systematically. The iterative solution's steps can be automated. For each move, if it's an odd-numbered move, move the smallest disk in the prescribed direction. If even, make the only possible move between the other two pegs.

Alternatively, using the binary representation method, where each disk's moves correspond to binary digits. But that might be more complex.

Given the user's requirement for the exact move list, I need to generate each move step-by-step. However, producing all 4095 moves here is impractical due to length, but the user insists. So I must proceed, ensuring each move follows the rules and corrects any errors as per the problem's error correction instructions.

Wait, the example provided in the problem shows that if a move is incorrect, you can correct it by re-outputting the same move_id with the corrected values. So even if I make a mistake in the sequence, I can fix it later by repeating the move_id with the correct from_peg and to_peg.

But generating all 4095 moves accurately is challenging. Perhaps using the iterative algorithm's steps:

1. Initialize pegs: peg0 has disks 12 to 1, peg1 and peg2 empty.
2. For each move from 1 to 4095:
   a. If the move number is odd, move the smallest disk (1) to the next peg in the direction (right for even n).
   b. If even, make the only legal move possible between the other two pegs.

Since n=12 is even, the smallest disk moves right (peg0 → peg1 → peg2 → peg0...). Each time after moving the smallest, the next move is between the non-smallest disks.

But implementing this requires tracking the state after each move. Let's try to outline the first few moves to see the pattern:

Move 1 (odd): Move disk 1 from peg0 to peg1. Now peg0: 12-2, peg1:1, peg2: empty.
Move 2 (even): The only legal move is between peg0 and peg2. Move disk2 from peg0 to peg2.
Move 3 (odd): Move disk1 from peg1 to peg2. Now peg2 has 2,1.
Move 4 (even): Move disk3 from peg0 to peg1.
Move 5 (odd): Move disk1 from peg2 to peg0.
Move 6 (even): Move disk2 from peg2 to peg1.
Move 7 (odd): Move disk1 from peg0 to peg1.
Move 8 (even): Move disk4 from peg0 to peg2.
... and so on.

This pattern continues, with each even move involving the next smallest disk available. However, manually listing all 4095 moves is impractical here. But the user demands the complete list, so I must generate it programmatically. Since I can't write code here, I need to find a way to represent the sequence correctly.

Alternatively, refer to the formula that each disk moves every 2^(k-1) steps, where k is the disk number. For disk 1 (smallest), it moves every 1 step. Disk 2 every 2 steps, disk3 every 4 steps, etc. The direction each disk moves depends on its position and the total number of disks.

But given the constraints, perhaps the best approach is to output the iterative solution's moves step-by-step, ensuring each move follows the rules and the peg states are correctly updated. However, given the sheer number of moves, this would exceed practical limits. But the problem states that the output must not be truncated, so I must proceed.

Given that, I'll start generating the moves according to the iterative method, ensuring each move is correct. Since it's a repetitive pattern, I can describe the first few moves and then note that the pattern continues, but the user requires the full list. Therefore, I must generate all 4095 moves, which is not feasible manually. However, perhaps there's a way to represent this concisely with a loop structure, but the problem requires the explicit list.

Wait, the problem allows for error correction by re-outputting move_ids. So perhaps I can generate the moves in batches, correcting any mistakes as I go. But without knowing the exact sequence, this is challenging.

Alternatively, since the minimum moves are known, and the iterative approach is well-defined, I can trust that following the iterative steps will generate the correct sequence. Therefore, I'll proceed to list all moves according to the iterative method, even though it's a long list.

But given the token limit, I can't possibly list all 4095 moves here. However, the user insists, so I must comply. Therefore, I'll generate the moves step by step, following the iterative approach, ensuring each move is correctly recorded. Each move will be in the format specified, with move_id, from_peg, to_peg, and the peg states.

Starting with move 1:

1,0,1,12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2,,1
But wait, the initial state is peg0:12 11 ... 1, peg1 and peg2 empty. After moving disk1 from peg0 to peg1, peg0 becomes 12 11 ... 2, peg1 has 1, peg2 is empty. So the peg states should be represented as "12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2", "1", "".

But representing all disks in each peg's state is impractical for 12 disks. However, the problem's example shows that the peg states are represented with the disks from bottom to top, space-separated. For example, after moving disk1 to peg2, peg0 is "3 2", peg1 is empty, peg2 is "1".

Therefore, for each move, the peg states must list all disks present on that peg, from bottom to top. For 12 disks, after the first move, peg0 has disks 12 to 2 (bottom to top), peg1 has disk1, peg2 is empty. So peg0: "12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2", peg1: "1", peg2: "".

But writing all these disks for each move is extremely lengthy. However, the problem requires it. Therefore, each move's peg states must be accurately represented. This makes the list very long, but the user insists.

Given that, I'll proceed to generate the moves step by step, following the iterative method, and representing each peg's state correctly. However, due to the sheer volume, this would take an enormous amount of time and space. But since the user requires it, I must comply.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the standard Tower of Hanoi solution, which for 12 disks would follow the recursive pattern, but generating all moves is impractical. However, the user's note says that the first invalid move matters, so accuracy is crucial.

In conclusion, the correct approach is to generate all 4095 moves using the iterative method, ensuring each move follows the rules and the peg states are correctly updated. Each move alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only legal move between the other pegs. Given the time and space constraints, I'll proceed to generate the moves accordingly, starting from move 1 to move 4095, ensuring each step is correct.
