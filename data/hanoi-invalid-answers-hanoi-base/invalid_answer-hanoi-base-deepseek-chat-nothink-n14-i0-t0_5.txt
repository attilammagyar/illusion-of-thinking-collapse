### Understanding the Problem

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another under specific constraints. Here's a recap of the rules:

1. **Only one disk can be moved at a time**: This means we can't move multiple disks simultaneously.
2. **Move the top disk**: We can only take the topmost disk from any peg and place it onto another peg.
3. **No larger disk on a smaller one**: At no point can a larger disk be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Given that we have 14 disks initially stacked on Peg 0 (with disk 1 being the smallest at the top and disk 14 being the largest at the bottom), our goal is to move the entire stack to Peg 2.

### General Strategy for Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi problem can be solved recursively. The recursive solution for moving `n` disks from a source peg to a target peg using an auxiliary peg is as follows:

1. Move `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg, using the target peg as a temporary holding area.
2. Move the `n-th` disk (the largest one) from the source peg directly to the target peg.
3. Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg, using the source peg as a temporary holding area.

This approach ensures that we never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one, adhering to the rules.

### Applying the Strategy to 14 Disks

For `n = 14`, the sequence of moves would be:

1. Move the top 13 disks from Peg 0 to Peg 1 (using Peg 2 as auxiliary).
2. Move disk 14 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
3. Move the 13 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (using Peg 0 as auxiliary).

Each of these steps involving 13 disks can be further broken down recursively until we're moving single disks.

### Generating the Move Sequence

Given the recursive nature of the solution, the total number of moves required is `2^n - 1`. For `n = 14`, this is `2^14 - 1 = 16383` moves. Enumerating all these moves manually is impractical, but we can describe the pattern or write an algorithm to generate them.

However, since the request is for the complete list of moves, I'll outline how the sequence starts and the general pattern, but providing all 16383 moves here isn't feasible due to space constraints. Instead, I can describe the recursive approach to generate the moves or provide a pseudocode that would output the sequence.

### Recursive Algorithm to Generate Moves

Here's a Python-like pseudocode to generate the moves:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n > 0:
        # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
        hanoi(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
        # Move the nth disk from source to target
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target
        hanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

# Initialize moves list
moves = []
# Call the function for 14 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 with peg 1 as auxiliary
hanoi(14, 0, 2, 1, moves)
```

### Initial and Final Moves

Given the recursive nature, the sequence starts by moving the smallest disks back and forth. Here's how the sequence begins and ends:

**First few moves:**
1. Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2
2. Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1
3. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1
4. Move disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2
5. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 0
6. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2
7. Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2
... and so on.

**Last few moves:**
... leading up to moving disk 14 from Peg 0 to Peg 2, followed by moving the stack of 13 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2.

### Complete Move Sequence

Given the impracticality of listing all 16383 moves here, the complete sequence can be generated by running the recursive algorithm provided above. The algorithm will correctly produce all moves in the required format `[disk, from, to]`.

### Final Answer

The complete sequence of moves to transfer 14 disks from Peg 0 to Peg 2 is generated by the recursive algorithm. Here's how the sequence starts and the general structure:

```python
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [5, 0, 2],
    ...
    # This continues until all 14 disks are moved to peg 2
]
```

For the exact full sequence, implementing the recursive algorithm in a programming environment would yield all 16383 moves in order. 

However, since listing all moves here is impractical, the key takeaway is that the sequence follows the recursive pattern where smaller disks are moved out of the way to allow larger disks to reach their destination, and this process repeats for each disk size. 

### Verification

To ensure correctness:
- No larger disk is ever placed on a smaller one.
- Each move involves only the top disk of a peg.
- The total number of moves is `2^14 - 1 = 16383`, which is the minimum number of moves required to solve the puzzle with 14 disks.

Thus, the sequence generated by the recursive algorithm is correct and complete.
