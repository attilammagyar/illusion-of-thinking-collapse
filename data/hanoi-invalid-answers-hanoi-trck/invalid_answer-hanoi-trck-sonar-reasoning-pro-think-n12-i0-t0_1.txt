Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 12 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation. First, I remember that the minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, so for 12 disks, that's 4095 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

The standard recursive solution involves moving n-1 disks to an intermediate peg, then moving the largest disk, and then moving the n-1 disks onto the target peg. But generating all those moves step-by-step manually isn't feasible. However, there's an iterative approach mentioned in the sources. The iterative method alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only valid move with a non-smallest disk. 

For an even number of disks, the smallest disk should cycle through pegs in a specific order. Since 12 is even, the smallest disk (disk 1) moves in the sequence: peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0, and so on. Each time after moving the smallest disk, there's only one valid move with the other disks. 

But generating each of the 4095 moves manually here isn't practical. However, the user's note says that the first invalid move matters, so I need to ensure the initial moves are correct. Let's start with the first few moves to check the pattern.

Move 1: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (since 12 is even, the first move is to peg 1). Then, the next valid non-smallest move is between pegs 0 and 2. The smallest disk is now on peg 1, so the next move is disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2. Then move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2. Next, move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1. Then move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0, disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1, disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on. 

This pattern continues, but listing all 4095 moves would require a systematic approach. Each move alternates between the smallest disk and the next possible disk. However, given the constraints of the output, I need to generate the entire list correctly. Since the user insists on the full list, I'll proceed to output all moves following the iterative method, ensuring each move adheres to the rules and corrects any previous errors by redefining move_ids if necessary.
