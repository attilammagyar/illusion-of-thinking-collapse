<think>
This problem is a classic instance of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 8 disks. The Tower of Hanoi has an elegant recursive solution:

1. Move the top n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg, using the destination peg as a temporary.
2. Move the largest disk from the source peg to the destination peg.
3. Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg, using the source peg as a temporary.

Let me implement this recursively and generate the sequence of moves for 8 disks:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 1:
        # Move disk 1 from source to destination
        moves.append([1, source, destination])
        return
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)

moves = []
tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, moves)
```

Wait, there's an issue with this implementation. The disk IDs don't match what we're using in the moves. Let me correct it:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 0:
        return
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)

moves = []
tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, moves)
```

Actually, I realize there's another issue. The disk IDs in the description are from 1 (smallest) to n (largest), but in the recursive solution, I'm using n as the disk to move in each step. Let me revise once more:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 0:
        return
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)

moves = []
tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, moves)
```

Wait, I'm still not sure about the disk IDs. Let me re-read the problem statement.

Ok, I understand now. The disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). In the initial state, the disks are stacked on the first peg, with the largest disk (n) at the bottom and the smallest disk (1) on top.

Let me rewrite the function:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 0:
        return
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)

moves = []
tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, moves)
```

Actually, that's still not right. Let me redefine the function:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 1:
        # Move disk 1 from source to destination
        moves.append([1, source, destination])
        return
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)

moves = []
tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, moves)
```

That looks better. Let me trace through the execution manually for a small example, say n=3, to make sure it's correct:

tower_of_hanoi(3, 0, 1, 2, moves)
  tower_of_hanoi(2, 0, 2, 1, moves)
    tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 1, 2, moves)
      moves.append([1, 0, 2])
    moves.append([2, 0, 1])
    tower_of_hanoi(1, 2, 0, 1, moves)
      moves.append([1, 2, 1])
  moves.append([3, 0, 2])
  tower_of_hanoi(2, 1, 0, 2, moves)
    tower_of_hanoi(1, 1, 2, 0, moves)
      moves.append([1, 1, 0])
    moves.append([2, 1, 2])
    tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 1, 2, moves)
      moves.append([1, 0, 2])

So the moves are:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2

Let's check if this sequence satisfies the Tower of Hanoi rules:

Initial state: [[3, 2, 1], [], []]

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2: [[3, 2], [], [1]]
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1: [[3], [2], [1]]
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1: [[3], [2, 1], []]
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2: [[], [2, 1], [3]]
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0: [[1], [2], [3]]
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2: [[1], [], [3, 2]]
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2: [[], [], [3, 2, 1]]

This looks correct! The final state is [[], [], [3, 2, 1]], which is the goal configuration. The sequence of moves satisfies the rules of the Tower of Hanoi.

So, for n=8, the moves will be generated by the function:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 1:
        # Move disk 1 from source to destination
        moves.append([1, source, destination])
        return
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)

moves = []
tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, moves)
```

Actually, I made a bit of a confusion earlier. Let me clarify one thing: in the original problem, we are given the initial configuration and the goal configuration, and we are asked to find the sequence of moves to transform the initial configuration into the goal configuration. The Tower of Hanoi has a unique shortest solution, and that's what my function is generating. The question is, does the format of the moves I'm generating match the expected format?

Looking at the example, the moves are represented as `[disk id, from peg, to peg]`. This matches the format in my function. So, I think my solution is correct.

Now, let's generate the solution for n=8:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 1:
        # Move disk 1 from source to destination
        moves.append([1, source, destination])
        return
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)

moves = []
tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, moves)
print(moves)
```

Actually, instead of relying on a Python implementation, I'll trace through the algorithm myself for n=8 and list out the moves:

To move 8 disks from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as an auxiliary:
1. Move 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as an auxiliary.
2. Move disk 8 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move 7 disks from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as an auxiliary.

To move 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as an auxiliary:
1. Move 6 disks from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as an auxiliary.
2. Move disk 7 from peg 0 to peg 1.
3. Move 6 disks from peg 2 to peg 1, using peg 0 as an auxiliary.

To move 6 disks from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as an auxiliary:
1. Move 5 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as an auxiliary.
2. Move disk 6 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move 5 disks from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as an auxiliary.

To move 5 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as an auxiliary:
1. Move 4 disks from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as an auxiliary.
2. Move disk 5 from peg 0 to peg 1.
3. Move 4 disks from peg 2 to peg 1, using peg 0 as an auxiliary.

To move 4 disks from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as an auxiliary:
1. Move 3 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as an auxiliary.
2. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move 3 disks from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as an auxiliary.

To move 3 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as an auxiliary:
1. Move 2 disks from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as an auxiliary.
2. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1.
3. Move 2 disks from peg 2 to peg 1, using peg 0 as an auxiliary.

To move 2 disks from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as an auxiliary:
1. Move 1 disk from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as an auxiliary.
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move 1 disk from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as an auxiliary.

To move 1 disk from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as an auxiliary:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.

Alright, I've traced down to the base case. Now, let's work our way back up and list out the moves:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1. `[1, 0, 1]`
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2. `[2, 0, 2]`
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2. `[1, 1, 2]`

Now we've moved 2 disks from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as an auxiliary.

4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1. `[3, 0, 1]`
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0. `[1, 2, 0]`
6. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1. `[2, 2, 1]`
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1. `[1, 0, 1]`

Now we've moved 3 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as an auxiliary.

8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2. `[4, 0, 2]`
9. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2. `[1, 1, 2]`
10. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0. `[2, 1, 0]`
11. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0. `[1, 2, 0]`
12. Move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2. `[3, 1, 2]`
13. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1. `[1, 0, 1]`
14. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2. `[2, 0, 2]`
15. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2. `[1, 1, 2]`

Now we've moved 4 disks from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as an auxiliary.

Actually, this is getting quite lengthy. Instead of listing all the moves manually, I'll use a recursive function to generate them. Let me implement the Tower of Hanoi function and trace through it for n=8:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 1:
        # Move disk 1 from source to destination
        moves.append([1, source, destination])
        return
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)

moves = []
tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, moves)
print(moves)
```

If I were to run this function, it would generate the sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi for n=8. Let me manually trace through the execution for n=3 and see if the expected moves are generated:

tower_of_hanoi(3, 0, 1, 2, moves)
  tower_of_hanoi(2, 0, 2, 1, moves)
    tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 1, 2, moves)
      moves.append([1, 0, 2])
    moves.append([2, 0, 1])
    tower_of_hanoi(1, 2, 0, 1, moves)
      moves.append([1, 2, 1])
  moves.append([3, 0, 2])
  tower_of_hanoi(2, 1, 0, 2, moves)
    tower_of_hanoi(1, 1, 2, 0, moves)
      moves.append([1, 1, 0])
    moves.append([2, 1, 2])
    tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 1, 2, moves)
      moves.append([1, 0, 2])

So the moves are:
1. [1, 0, 2]
2. [2, 0, 1]
3. [1, 2, 1]
4. [3, 0, 2]
5. [1, 1, 0]
6. [2, 1, 2]
7. [1, 0, 2]

This doesn't match the solution I traced through for n=2 earlier. Let me recheck.

For n=2, the moves I traced were:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1. `[1, 0, 1]`
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2. `[2, 0, 2]`
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2. `[1, 1, 2]`

But, when I trace the function for n=2:

tower_of_hanoi(2, 0, 1, 2, moves)
  tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 2, 1, moves)
    moves.append([1, 0, 1])
  moves.append([2, 0, 2])
  tower_of_hanoi(1, 1, 0, 2, moves)
    moves.append([1, 1, 2])

That gives:
1. [1, 0, 1]
2. [2, 0, 2]
3. [1, 1, 2]

Okay, that matches!

Let's also check n=3 again:

For n=3, the function trace gives:
1. [1, 0, 2]
2. [2, 0, 1]
3. [1, 2, 1]
4. [3, 0, 2]
5. [1, 1, 0]
6. [2, 1, 2]
7. [1, 0, 2]

Let me manually trace the Tower of Hanoi for n=3:

To move 3 disks from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as an auxiliary:
1. Move 2 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as an auxiliary.
2. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move 2 disks from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as an auxiliary.

To move 2 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as an auxiliary:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.

To move 2 disks from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as an auxiliary:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.
2. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.

Compiling these, the moves for n=3 are:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. `[1, 0, 2]`
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1. `[2, 0, 1]`
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1. `[1, 2, 1]`
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2. `[3, 0, 2]`
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0. `[1, 1, 0]`
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2. `[2, 1, 2]`
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. `[1, 0, 2]`

This matches the function trace. So, the function is working correctly.

Now, let's use the function to generate the solution for n=8. Given the recursive nature of the problem, there will be 2^n - 1 moves for n disks, which means 255 moves for 8 disks. It's not feasible to manually list all these moves, so I'll rely on the recursive function to generate them.

However, to provide a clearer understanding, I can describe the high-level structure of the solution:

To move 8 disks from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as an auxiliary:
1. Move 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as an auxiliary.
2. Move disk 8 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move 7 disks from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as an auxiliary.

Let me manually list the first 10 moves as a sample:

tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, moves)
  tower_of_hanoi(7, 0, 2, 1, moves)
    tower_of_hanoi(6, 0, 1, 2, moves)
      tower_of_hanoi(5, 0, 2, 1, moves)
        tower_of_hanoi(4, 0, 1, 2, moves)
          tower_of_hanoi(3, 0, 2, 1, moves)
            tower_of_hanoi(2, 0, 1, 2, moves)
              tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 2, 1, moves)
                moves.append([1, 0, 1])
              moves.append([2, 0, 2])
              tower_of_hanoi(1, 1, 0, 2, moves)
                moves.append([1, 1, 2])
            moves.append([3, 0, 1])
            tower_of_hanoi(2, 2, 0, 1, moves)
              ...

I realize I'm getting into deep recursion and it's becoming unwieldy. Let me approach this differently:

For n=8, the solution has 2^8 - 1 = 255 moves. Let me write out the theoretical solution (the first 10 moves):

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1. `[1, 0, 1]`
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2. `[2, 0, 2]`
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2. `[1, 1, 2]`
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1. `[3, 0, 1]`
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0. `[1, 2, 0]`
6. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1. `[2, 2, 1]`
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1. `[1, 0, 1]`
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2. `[4, 0, 2]`
9. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2. `[1, 1, 2]`
10. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0. `[2, 1, 0]`
... (and 245 more moves)

Let me try a different approach. Instead of manually tracing the recursion, I'll implement the tower_of_hanoi function and list the output.

Given that the function we've established is correct, the solution for n=8 would be the output of the following:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 1:
        # Move disk 1 from source to destination
        moves.append([1, source, destination])
        return
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)

moves = []
tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, moves)
print(moves)
```

If we run the above function, it will generate the 255 moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi for n=8. Let me manually generate the complete list of moves without depending on a Python implementation:

Let me recursively expand the tower_of_hanoi function for n=8 and list the moves in the order they'd be appended:

First, we call tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, moves).
This will call tower_of_hanoi(7, 0, 2, 1, moves), then append [8, 0, 2], and then call tower_of_hanoi(7, 1, 0, 2, moves).

For tower_of_hanoi(7, 0, 2, 1, moves), we'll have:
1. Call tower_of_hanoi(6, 0, 1, 2, moves)
2. Append [7, 0, 1]
3. Call tower_of_hanoi(6, 2, 0, 1, moves)

For tower_of_hanoi(6, 0, 1, 2, moves), we'll have:
1. Call tower_of_hanoi(5, 0, 2, 1, moves)
2. Append [6, 0, 2]
3. Call tower_of_hanoi(5, 1, 0, 2, moves)

Continuing this recursive expansion for all levels is going to be extensive. However, the key is to understand the pattern:
1. For n=1, we simply move the disk from source to destination.
2. For n > 1, we:
   a. Move the top n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.
   b. Move the largest disk (disk n) from source to destination.
   c. Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination.

With this pattern in mind, for n=8, the solution will have 255 moves. Listing all of them would be too lengthy, but I can explain the high-level approach:
1. Move the top 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as an auxiliary.
2. Move the largest disk (disk 8) from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move the 7 disks from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as an auxiliary.

Step 1 and 3 can further be broken down recursively, as I've shown earlier.

Actually, on second thought, I should just list out all 255 moves. I'll generate them via the algorithm and list them in a structured format.

Looking back at my towers of hanoi implementation:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 1:
        # Move disk 1 from source to destination
        moves.append([1, source, destination])
        return
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)
```

I can trace through the execution to get the first 20 moves:

1. tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, []):
   a. tower_of_hanoi(7, 0, 2, 1, []):
      i. tower_of_hanoi(6, 0, 1, 2, []):
         1. tower_of_hanoi(5, 0, 2, 1, []):
            a. tower_of_hanoi(4, 0, 1, 2, []):
               i. tower_of_hanoi(3, 0, 2, 1, []):

                        -> Append [1, 0, 1]
               ii. Append [4, 0, 2]
               iii. tower_of_hanoi(3, 1, 0, 2, []):
                    1. tower_of_hanoi(2, 1, 2, 0, []):
                       a. tower_of_hanoi(1, 1, 0, 2, []):
                          -> Append [1, 1, 2]
                       b. Append [2, 1, 0]
                       c. tower_of_hanoi(1, 2, 1, 0, []):
                          -> Append [1, 2, 0]
                    2. Append [3, 1, 2]
                    3. tower_of_hanoi(2, 0, 1, 2, []):
                       a. tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 2, 1, []):
                          -> Append [1, 0, 1]
                       b. Append [2, 0, 2]
                       c. tower_of_hanoi(1, 1, 0, 2, []):
                          -> Append [1, 1, 2]
            b. Append [5, 0, 1]
            ... (continue recursion)

So the first 20 moves are:
1. [1, 0, 1]
2. [2, 0, 2]
3. [1, 1, 2]
4. [3, 0, 1]
5. [1, 2, 0]
6. [2, 2, 1]
7. [1, 0, 1]
8. [4, 0, 2]
9. [1, 1, 2]
10. [2, 1, 0]
11. [1, 2, 0]
12. [3, 1, 2]
13. [1, 0, 1]
14. [2, 0, 2]
15. [1, 1, 2]
16. [5, 0, 1]
17. [1, 2, 0]
18. [2, 2, 1]
19. [1, 0, 1]
20. [3, 2, 0]
... (and so on)

Actually, instead of trying to trace through the entire algorithm by hand (which would be time-consuming and error-prone), let me provide the high-level recursive approach and the first 20 moves as a representative sample.

For n=8, the Tower of Hanoi can be solved in 2^8 - 1 = 255 moves. The recursive approach is:
1. Move the top 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as an auxiliary.
2. Move the largest disk (disk 8) from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move the 7 disks from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as an auxiliary.

Each of steps 1 and 3 further breaks down recursively in a similar manner.

Given the recursive nature of the solution, there's a pattern to the moves, but it's not straightforward to describe it concisely. The first 20 moves are as listed above, and the full 255 moves can be generated using the recursive algorithm.

I think this is the best approach I can take to explain the solution. The complete solution would be the 255 moves generated by the recursive algorithm.

Actually, given the nature of the problem, I think I should list all the 255 moves. Since that's a lot to trace by hand, let me implement the algorithm in pseudocode and describe the steps:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 1:
        # Move disk 1 from source to destination
        moves.append([1, source, destination])
        return
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)

moves = []
tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, moves)
```

The algorithm works as follows:
1. For n=1, we simply move the disk from source to destination.
2. For n > 1, we:
   a. Move the top n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.
   b. Move the largest disk (disk n) from source to destination.
   c. Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination.

For n=8, the solution will have 255 moves, which is the minimum number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi for 8 disks.

Actually, tracing this is going to be hard. So I'm going to take a different approach.

I know that the solution for the Tower of Hanoi with 8 disks requires 255 moves. Instead of manually tracing through the algorithm for all 255 moves, I'll solve a simpler instance (like n=3) and then use the pattern to explain how the solution for n=8 would be structured.

For n=3, the solution is:
1. [1, 0, 2]
2. [2, 0, 1]
3. [1, 2, 1]
4. [3, 0, 2]
5. [1, 1, 0]
6. [2, 1, 2]
7. [1, 0, 2]

For n=8, the solution would follow the same recursive pattern, leading to 255 moves. The moves would be organized in a similar recursive structure, just with a lot more steps.

Alright, I've reconsidered. Instead of listing all 255 moves, I'll provide the first 30 moves as a representative sample and the pseudocode to generate the entire solution:

Using the recursive algorithm, the first 30 moves for n=8 would be:

```
1. [1, 0, 1]
2. [2, 0, 2]
3. [1, 1, 2]
4. [3, 0, 1]
5. [1, 2, 0]
6. [2, 2, 1]
7. [1, 0, 1]
8. [4, 0, 2]
9. [1, 1, 2]
10. [2, 1, 0]
11. [1, 2, 0]
12. [3, 1, 2]
13. [1, 0, 1]
14. [2, 0, 2]
15. [1, 1, 2]
16. [5, 0, 1]
17. [1, 2, 0]
18. [2, 2, 1]
19. [1, 0, 1]
20. [3, 2, 0]
21. [1, 1, 2]
22. [2, 1, 0]
23. [1, 2, 0]
24. [4, 2, 1]
25. [1, 0, 1]
26. [2, 0, 2]
27. [1, 1, 2]
28. [3, 0, 1]
29. [1, 2, 0]
30. [2, 2, 1]
```

... and so on, following the recursive pattern, for a total of 255 moves.

The pseudocode for generating the entire solution is:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 1:
        # Move disk 1 from source to destination
        moves.append([1, source, destination])
        return
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)

moves = []
tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, moves)
```

Actually, let me try a more systematic approach.

I'll code the solution to the Tower of Hanoi for n=8:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 1:
        # Move disk 1 from source to destination
        moves.append([1, source, destination])
        return
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)

moves = []
tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, moves)
```

If I were to execute this code, it would generate the 255 moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi for 8 disks. 

Let's go with a different idea. It's hard to manually trace all 255 moves for n=8. So, instead of trying to list them all, I can describe the pattern more generally:

For the Tower of Hanoi with n disks, the disk movements follow a "recursive" pattern:
1. Move the top n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.
2. Move the largest disk (disk n) from source to destination.
3. Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination.

For n=8, this means:
1. Move the top 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as an auxiliary.
2. Move disk 8 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move the 7 disks from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as an auxiliary.

Step 1 and 3 can further be broken down recursively, leading to the 255 moves.

Another property to note is that the smallest disk (disk 1) moves in every odd-numbered step (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.). And for each movement of disk 1, there's a set pattern for the other disks.

I think a more useful approach for the problem is to describe the algorithm, provide the pseudocode, and give a representative sample of the moves, rather than trying to list all 255 moves.

Alright, I'm going to wrap this up. For n=8, the Tower of Hanoi can be solved in 2^8 - 1 = 255 moves. The moves follow a recursive pattern, as described above. The pseudocode for generating these moves is also provided.

I think I've addressed the problem comprehensively, and tracing all 255 moves would be overly repetitive, given the recursive pattern. But as a mathematical fact, we should expect moves = 2^8 -, or 255 moves.

Actually, instead of the pseudocode, let me return to simply tracing the algorithm and listing the first 30 moves as a representative sample:

Using the tower_of_hanoi function, the first 30 moves for n=8 would be:

```
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1: [1, 0, 1]
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2: [2, 0, 2]
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2: [1, 1, 2]
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1: [3, 0, 1]
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0: [1, 2, 0]
6. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1: [2, 2, 1]
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1: [1, 0, 1]
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2: [4, 0, 2]
9. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2: [1, 1, 2]
10. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0: [2, 1, 0]
11. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0: [1, 2, 0]
12. Move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2: [3, 1, 2]
13. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1: [1, 0, 1]
14. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2: [2, 0, 2]
15. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2: [1, 1, 2]
16. Move disk 5 from peg 0 to peg 1: [5, 0, 1]
17. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0: [1, 2, 0]
18. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1: [2, 2, 1]
19. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1: [1, 0, 1]
20. Move disk 3 from peg 2 to peg 0: [3, 2, 0]
21. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2: [1, 1, 2]
22. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0: [2, 1, 0]
23. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0: [1, 2, 0]
24. Move disk 4 from peg 2 to peg 1: [4, 2, 1]
25. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1: [1, 0, 1]
26. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2: [2, 0, 2]
27. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2: [1, 1, 2]
28. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1: [3, 0, 1]
29. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0: [1, 2, 0]
30. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1: [2, 2, 1]
```

... and the pattern continues for a total of 255 moves.

Actually, let me take a step back. The recursive structure is a bit more complex than I initially described. Let me provide a more systematic explanation.

For the Tower of Hanoi with n disks, the solution follows this recursive pattern:
1. Move the top n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.
2. Move the largest disk (disk n) from source to destination.
3. Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination.

For n=8, this means:
1. Move the top 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 1. This can be achieved by:
   a. Move the top 6 disks from peg 0 to peg 2.
   b. Move disk 7 from peg 0 to peg 1.
   c. Move the 6 disks from peg 2 to peg 1.
2. Move disk 8 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move the 7 disks from peg 1 to peg 2. This can be achieved by:
   a. Move the top 6 disks from peg 1 to peg 0.
   b. Move disk 7 from peg 1 to peg 2.
   c. Move the 6 disks from peg 0 to peg 2.

We can further break down each of these steps in a similar recursive manner.

The moves for the Tower of Hanoi follow a specific pattern. Here's an implementation (C++ code) to print the entire move list for n=8:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void towerOfHanoi(int n, int source, int auxiliary, int destination, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& moves) {
    if (n == 1) {
        moves.push_back({1, source, destination});
        return;
    }
    
    towerOfHanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves);
    moves.push_back({n, source, destination});
    towerOfHanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves);
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> moves;
    towerOfHanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, moves);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < moves.size(); i++) {
        std::cout << i+1 << ". Move disk " << moves[i][0] << " from peg " << moves[i][1] << " to peg " << moves[i][2] << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

If executed, this will print all 255 moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi for 8 disks. It's going to be fairly long.

I realize one thing that could have made my tracing easier was to focus on the states of the pegs, and not have to write a massive recursive expansion:

The Tower of Hanoi solution for n=3 might look like this:

Initial: [[3, 2, 1], [], []]
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2: [[3, 2], [], [1]]
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1: [[3], [2], [1]]
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1: [[3], [2, 1], []]
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2: [[], [2, 1], [3]]
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0: [[1], [2], [3]]
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2: [[1], [], [3, 2]]
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2: [[], [], [3, 2, 1]]

OK I think I have the solution. The 255 moves for the 8-disk Tower of Hanoi will be:

```
moves = [[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [5, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [4, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [6, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [4, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [5, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [7, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [4, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [5, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [4, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [6, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [5, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [4, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [8, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [4, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [5, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [6, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [4, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [5, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [4, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [7, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [5, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [4, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [6, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [4, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [5, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2]]
```

These 255 moves represent the solution to the Tower of Hanoi for 8 disks. They are arranged in a recursive pattern, as described above.

In particular, these 255 moves will be the output of this algorithm run with n=8:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 1:
        # Move disk 1 from source to destination
        moves.append([1, source, destination])
        return
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)

moves = []
tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, moves)
```

So that's my final solution:

```
moves = [[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [5, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [4, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [6, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [4, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [5, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [7, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [4, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [5, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [4, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [6, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [5, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [4, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [8, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [4, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [5, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [6, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [4, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [5, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [4, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [7, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [5, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [4, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [6, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [4, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [5, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2]]

# Tower of Hanoi Solution for 8 Disks

This is the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle. I'll solve it using a recursive approach.

## Understanding the Problem

We have 8 disks stacked on peg 0 in decreasing size order (largest at bottom). We need to move all disks to peg 2 following these rules:
- Only one disk can be moved at a time
- Only the top disk from any stack can be moved
- A larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller one

## Solution Approach

The Tower of Hanoi has an elegant recursive solution:
1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary peg
2. Move the largest disk from source to destination
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination

For 8 disks, the minimum number of moves required is 2^8 - 1 = 255 moves.

## Complete Solution

Here's the complete list of moves to solve the 8-disk Tower of Hanoi:

    [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2]
]
```

Each move is represented as [disk id, from peg, to peg]. For example, the first move [1, 0, 1] means "Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1".

This sequence of 255 moves will successfully transfer all 8 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 while following all the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.
