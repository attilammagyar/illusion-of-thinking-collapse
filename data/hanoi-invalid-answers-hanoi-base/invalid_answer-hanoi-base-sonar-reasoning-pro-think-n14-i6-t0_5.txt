Okay, so I need to figure out the sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 14 disks, moving them all from peg 0 to peg 2. Let's start by recalling what I know about the Tower of Hanoi problem.

First, the classic solution for Tower of Hanoi is recursive. For n disks, you move the top n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the target peg, and then move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg. The minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, which for 14 disks would be 2^14 - 1 = 16383 moves. That's a lot, but the problem is asking for the sequence, not just the number.

But writing out all 16383 moves manually isn't feasible. However, there's an iterative approach mentioned in the search results. From source [2], the iterative solution involves alternating moves between the smallest disk and a non-smallest disk. The direction to move the smallest disk depends on whether the number of disks is even or odd. Since we have 14 disks, which is even, the smallest disk should move in a specific pattern. 

Wait, the search result [2] says that for an even number of disks, the stack ends up on peg C (which would be peg 2 in our case, since pegs are 0-indexed as 0,1,2). That aligns with the goal here. The iterative method for even n involves moving the smallest disk in a consistent direction. Let me check the details.

From [2], the iterative solution steps are:
1. Move the smallest disk to the next peg in a specific direction (right if even, left if odd). Since 14 is even, the direction is to the right. So the first move would be disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1. Wait, but the pegs are 0,1,2. Moving right from 0 would be to 1, then next right would be to 2, then wrap around to 0 again. So for even n, the smallest disk moves in a cycle: 0→1→2→0→1→2 etc.

But according to the example in [2], for three disks (odd), the smallest moves to the opposite end. Wait, maybe I need to clarify. The iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For each step:

- Move the smallest disk in a specific direction (right for even n, left for odd n).
- Then make the only valid move possible that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

So for 14 disks (even), the smallest disk (disk 1) starts at peg 0. The first move is to move it to peg 1 (right). Then the next move is the only possible move not involving disk 1, which would be moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2. Then move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2. Then move disk 3 from peg 0 to... wait, but disk 3 can't go on top of disk 2 if it's larger. Wait, maybe I need to follow the algorithm step by step.

Alternatively, the iterative approach can be broken down into repeating a sequence of three steps until completion, as mentioned in [2]:

1. Move one disk from peg A to peg B or vice versa, whichever is legal.
2. Move one disk from peg A to peg C or vice versa, whichever is legal.
3. Move one disk from peg B to peg C or vice versa, whichever is legal.

But the pegs are labeled 0,1,2. So perhaps peg A is 0, B is 1, C is 2. Following this, the steps would cycle through these moves. However, this might be a different way to structure it.

Alternatively, the solution from [5] mentions an algorithm where for odd-numbered disks, you move disk 1 to the left each time, and for even, to the right. Since we have 14 disks (even), the initial move of disk 1 would be to the right (peg 1). Then the next move is the next possible non-smallest disk. 

But generating the entire sequence manually for 14 disks is impractical. However, the problem requires the complete list of moves. Since it's a standard Tower of Hanoi problem, the solution can be generated algorithmically. The recursive approach is straightforward but would require implementing the algorithm. However, given that the user expects the list of moves here, perhaps there's a pattern or a way to represent the moves without listing all 16k steps.

Wait, but the example given in the problem for 3 disks has a specific sequence. Let me look at that example again. The example with 3 disks has moves like [1,0,2], [2,0,1], etc. Each move is [disk, from, to]. So for 3 disks, the minimal solution is 7 moves. The recursive approach would generate that sequence.

For 14 disks, the solution would follow the same recursive pattern but scaled up. However, writing out all moves here isn't feasible. But the user is asking for the complete list. Wait, but perhaps the answer is to provide the algorithm to generate the moves, but the problem says "the final answer includes the complete list of moves". That seems impossible here, as 14 disks require 16383 moves. But maybe the user expects the recognition that it's a standard Tower of Hanoi problem and the minimal number of moves, along with the method to generate them, but given the constraints of the answer, perhaps the assistant is supposed to provide the recursive approach's sequence, but in reality, it's not possible to list all moves here.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the example given for 3 disks shows a specific sequence of moves. The user is asking for the sequence for 14 disks. However, given the sheer number of moves (16k+), it's impossible to list them all here. But perhaps the problem expects the assistant to outline the method to generate the moves, perhaps via the recursive algorithm, and then state that the complete list follows that pattern, but given the length, it's not practical to list all. However, the problem's requirements state: "Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]".

This is conflicting because with 14 disks, the list would be enormous. But perhaps the user is expecting an understanding of the pattern and the ability to generate it programmatically. However, given that the assistant can't execute code, maybe the answer should explain the method and acknowledge that the full list is too long but can be generated using the recursive or iterative approach.

Wait, looking at the search results, source [2] mentions the iterative solution. Let me check that again. The iterative solution for even n (14) would involve moving the smallest disk in a specific direction each time. For even n, the smallest disk moves to the right (peg 0→1→2→0...), and for each non-smallest move, there's only one legal move.

So the algorithm would be:

1. Move the smallest disk (1) to the next peg in the direction (right for even n).
2. Make the only possible move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.
3. Repeat until all disks are on peg 2.

Following this, each pair of moves would involve moving the smallest disk, then another disk. This pattern continues until completion.

But how to translate this into the sequence of moves? Let's take the 3-disk example. The minimal solution is 7 moves. Using the iterative method for odd n (3 is odd), the direction for the smallest disk is left. Let's see:

Move 1: disk 1 from 0→2 (left would be peg 0→2 if pegs are arranged circularly? Wait, maybe the direction is cyclic. For odd n, the smallest moves to the left (0→2, 2→1, 1→0, etc.), and for even n, to the right (0→1, 1→2, 2→0, etc.)

But the example given in the problem for 3 disks starts with [1,0,2], which is moving disk 1 from peg 0 to 2. Then [2,0,1], moving disk 2 from 0 to 1. Then [1,2,1], moving disk 1 from 2 to 1. Then [3,0,2], moving disk 3 from 0 to 2. Then [1,1,0], [2,1,2], [1,0,2]. So the sequence alternates between moving the smallest and then another disk.

But generating this for 14 disks would require following the iterative steps. However, without executing code, it's impossible to list all moves here. Therefore, perhaps the answer should explain the method and provide the algorithm to generate the moves, acknowledging that the full list is too lengthy to include.

But the user's query specifically says: "Find the sequence of moves to transform the initial configuration into the goal configuration." And the requirements state: "Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]".

This is a problem because 14 disks require 16383 moves. It's impossible to list them all here. Therefore, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe the user is expecting a general solution or a way to generate the moves, but given the instructions, the assistant must provide the complete list. However, given the constraints, it's not feasible. 

Wait, looking back at the search results, source [3] is a video showing the solution for 14 disks. But the assistant can't watch the video. However, the standard solution is well-known. The assistant might need to explain that the solution follows the standard Tower of Hanoi algorithm, which can be implemented recursively or iteratively, and that the minimal number of moves is 2^14 - 1 = 16383. However, providing the entire sequence here is impractical. 

But the user's example for 3 disks includes the full move list. Maybe the assistant is expected to provide a similar list, but for 14 disks. However, that's impossible due to length. Therefore, perhaps the answer should outline the method and note that the complete list can be generated using the iterative approach, providing the first few and last few moves as an example, but the user might need a programmatic solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can provide the recursive algorithm's pseudocode, which can generate the moves. For example, the recursive function would be:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}")
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}")
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

For 14 disks, calling hanoi(14, 0, 2, 1) would generate the moves. Each move of a disk n is preceded by moving all smaller disks off it, then moving it, then moving the smaller disks back on top. 

But translating this into the list of moves requires knowing the exact order. However, without running the code, the assistant can't list all 16383 moves. Therefore, the answer must explain that the solution follows the standard recursive algorithm and that the complete move list can be generated using this method, but due to its length, it's not feasible to list all moves here. However, the user's problem statement requires the complete list. This is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the user is actually expecting the assistant to recognize that the solution is the standard Tower of Hanoi sequence and that the exact moves can be generated programmatically, but since the assistant can't execute code, the answer must describe the method and provide the algorithm, perhaps with a small example, and note that applying it recursively will yield all moves. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question, and the assistant is supposed to realize that moving 14 disks requires 16383 moves, which is too many to list, and thus the answer should state that the sequence is too long to provide here but can be generated using the recursive or iterative method described. However, the user's instructions explicitly require the complete list. 

Given this impasse, perhaps the assistant should proceed by explaining the method and providing the algorithm, then state that due to the length, the full list isn't included but can be generated using the code. However, the user's requirements say to include the complete list. This suggests that perhaps there's an error in the problem setup, or maybe the user expects the assistant to provide a way to generate the moves rather than list them. 

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can provide the moves in a compressed form, such as a mathematical formula or a generator function. But the problem requires the list in the specified format. 

Given all this, the most feasible answer is to explain the recursive algorithm, provide a small example (like for 3 disks), and then note that applying the same approach for 14 disks will generate the 16383 moves, but listing them all is impractical. However, the user's problem statement explicitly requires the complete list. This is a contradiction, so perhaps the assistant should proceed by explaining the method and providing the first few and last few moves as an illustration, then note that the full list follows the same pattern.

But the user's example for 3 disks includes the full 7 moves. For 14, it's 16383. Therefore, the assistant must find a way to represent this. However, given the platform's limitations, it's impossible to output such a long list. Therefore, the answer should explain the method, state the number of moves, and provide the algorithm to generate them, perhaps with a code snippet. 

Looking at the search results, source [2] mentions the iterative solution, and source [5] provides steps for the algorithm. The solution from [5] for even n involves moving disk 1 to the right each time, then moving the next available disk. 

In conclusion, the assistant should outline the iterative method for even n (14), explain the direction of the smallest disk, and provide the algorithm steps. Then, acknowledge that the complete list is too long to include but can be generated using the described method. However, the user's instructions demand the complete list, so this is a problem. 

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can provide the moves in a compressed notation, but the problem requires the specific format. Given this, the only possible answer is to explain the method and note that the complete list follows the pattern, but it's too lengthy to include here. However, the user's query explicitly asks for the sequence, so this might not suffice. 

Given the constraints, the assistant must proceed to explain the method and provide the algorithm, perhaps with a code example that generates the moves, even though the actual list isn't provided. The answer should comply as much as possible within the platform's limitations.

The Tower of Hanoi problem with 14 disks requires 16,383 moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2 while adhering to the rules. The optimal solution follows a recursive pattern, but an iterative approach (more efficient for manual execution) alternates between moving the smallest disk and the only other legal move available. For 14 disks (even number), the smallest disk (disk 1) moves cyclically to the right (peg 0 → 1 → 2 → 0...), while non-smallest disks follow deterministic rules.

### Key Steps for the Iterative Solution:
1. **Smallest disk movement**:  
   - Move disk 1 to the next peg in the direction (right for even disk counts).
   - Repeat this direction after each non-smallest disk move.

2. **Non-smallest disk movement**:  
   - Make the only valid move that doesn’t involve disk 1.

### Example Initial Moves for 14 Disks:
```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 1],  # Smallest disk moves right
    [2, 0, 2],  # Next valid move (disk 2 to peg 2)
    [1, 1, 2],  # Smallest disk continues right
    [3, 0, 1],  # Next valid move (disk 3 to peg 1)
    [1, 2, 0],  # Smallest disk wraps around
    [2, 2, 1],  # Disk 2 moves to peg 1
    [1, 0, 1],  # Smallest disk resumes right
    ...
]
```

### Final Moves:
The sequence concludes by placing disk 14 on peg 2, followed by rebuilding the stack:
```
...
    [14, 0, 2],  # Largest disk reaches target
    [1, 1, 2],   # Rebuild smaller disks atop
    [2, 1, 0],
    [1, 2, 0],
    ...
    [1, 0, 2]    # Final move (disk 1 to peg 2)
]
```

### Algorithm to Generate All Moves:
The recursive formula for generating moves is:
```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, target]]
    else:
        moves = hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        moves += hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)
        return moves

moves = hanoi(14, 0, 2, 1)
```

This produces the **16,383-move sequence** following the pattern above. Due to length, the full list isn’t included here, but it can be generated programmatically using this recursive method[2][4].
