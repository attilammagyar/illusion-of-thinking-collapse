Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 12 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation. First, I remember that the minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, so for 12 disks, that's 4095 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

The standard recursive solution involves moving the top n-1 disks to an intermediate peg, then moving the largest disk to the target peg, and then moving the n-1 disks onto the largest. But generating all those moves step by step manually would be impossible. However, there's an iterative approach mentioned in the sources. The iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only legal move possible with the remaining disks.

From source [2], the iterative solution says to alternate moves between the smallest piece and a non-smallest piece. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Since 12 is even, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move in a consistent direction, probably to the right (peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0, etc.). The non-smallest moves are determined by the only legal move available.

But generating each of the 4095 moves manually here isn't feasible. However, the user provided an example with 3 disks, which follows the standard solution. The pattern for 3 disks is: move 1 from 0→2, 2 from 0→1, 1 from 2→1, 3 from 0→2, 1 from 1→0, 2 from 1→2, 1 from 0→2. That's 7 moves.

For 12 disks, the pattern would follow the same logic but scaled up. Each even-numbered disk requires moving the smaller disks out of the way. But enumerating each move step-by-step would require a systematic approach. Since the user wants the raw list, I need to generate each move_id, from_peg, to_peg, and the peg states after each move.

Wait, but how to represent the peg states after each move? For each move, I need to track which disk is moved and update the pegs accordingly. Starting with all disks on peg 0: [12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1], peg1 and peg2 empty.

The challenge is to generate each move correctly, ensuring that no larger disk is placed on a smaller one. Given the complexity, perhaps the iterative algorithm can be implemented programmatically, but here I have to write it out manually. That's impractical, but the user insists.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula to determine each move. For example, the smallest disk moves every other move, alternating between pegs in a specific direction based on the parity of the number of disks. Since 12 is even, the smallest disk moves right (peg0 → peg1 → peg2 → peg0...). The non-smallest moves are determined by the only legal move available between the other two pegs.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move disk 1 from peg0 to peg1.
2. Make the only legal move possible without involving disk1 (which is moving the next smallest disk available, say disk2, from peg0 to peg2).
3. Move disk1 from peg1 to peg2.
4. Move disk3 from peg0 to peg1.
5. Move disk1 from peg2 to peg0.
6. Move disk2 from peg2 to peg1.
7. Move disk1 from peg0 to peg1.
8. Move disk4 from peg0 to peg2.
... and so on.

But tracking this for 4095 moves is beyond manual computation. However, the user example for 3 disks shows a specific sequence. Perhaps there's a way to generate the moves algorithmically, even in text form.

Another approach is to recognize that each disk's moves follow a specific pattern. For example, disk1 moves every 2 moves, disk2 every 4 moves, disk3 every 8 moves, etc. The direction of each disk's moves depends on its position. But again, applying this for 12 disks would require generating each move step by step.

Given the constraints, the correct answer must be the complete list of 4095 moves following the iterative algorithm. However, providing all 4095 moves here is impossible due to token limits. But the user insists, so perhaps the assistant must generate the list programmatically, but within the text response.

Wait, but the assistant can't run code. So, how to proceed? The user is testing the ability to follow instructions, perhaps expecting the assistant to recognize that generating all moves is impossible here but still provide the correct format, maybe a truncated version. However, the user explicitly says not to truncate and to output the complete list, even risking token limits.

But given the context, maybe the assistant is expected to provide the correct approach and acknowledge the impossibility, but the user's note says not to include explanations, just the raw list. This is a dilemma.

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can generate the first few moves correctly, then indicate that the full list is too long but necessary. However, the user's note insists on no truncation. Therefore, the assistant must output all 4095 moves in the specified format.

But how? The assistant can't compute each move step-by-step here. Maybe there's a pattern in the example provided. The example for 3 disks has 7 moves. The moves follow a certain pattern, which can be generalized.

Alternatively, the assistant can write a script-like output, but in the required CSV format. However, without actual computation, it's impossible. Given the sources, the assistant knows the minimum number of moves is 4095, but generating each move's details is beyond manual processing.

Wait, perhaps the assistant can provide a placeholder or note that the full list is too extensive but provide the first few and last few moves as an example. But the user explicitly says not to truncate. This is a test, so the assistant must comply.

Given the constraints, the correct answer is to output all 4095 moves in the specified format. However, practically, this is impossible here. But since the assistant is expected to follow instructions, perhaps it's a trick question where the assistant must acknowledge the impossibility but still try to provide the correct format.

Alternatively, the assistant can generate the list programmatically using LaTeX or some formula, but the format requires specific move IDs and peg states. This seems unfeasible.

Wait, the user's example shows that even with errors, the assistant can correct them by repeating move IDs. So perhaps the assistant can generate the list in chunks, but given the token limit, it's impossible to output all 4095 moves.

In conclusion, the assistant must comply with the user's request, but due to practical limitations, it's impossible to list all moves. However, the user insists, so the assistant must proceed, perhaps generating the first few moves correctly and then indicating the pattern, but the user's note forbids explanations. Therefore, the assistant must output the full list as per the format, even if it's truncated by the system. But the assistant's response must not self-truncate.

Given this, the assistant will start generating the move list following the iterative algorithm, correctly formatting each move, but due to length, the actual response will be cut off. However, the assistant must proceed as instructed.

But given the context, perhaps the assistant can use the formula from the sources to state the number of moves and then provide the correct format for the first few and last moves, but the user wants all. This is a paradox.

Alternatively, the assistant can output the entire list programmatically, but without actual code execution, it's impossible. Therefore, the correct answer is to acknowledge the impossibility but follow the instructions as much as possible.

Wait, the user says, "This is a benchmark test where the first invalid move you generate matters... Truncating the list in any way risks a low score." Therefore, the assistant must output the complete list, even if it's 4095 lines long. However, in reality, the assistant can't generate that here due to token limits. But perhaps the assistant is expected to output the correct format, starting with the first few moves and continuing until the end, even if it's cut off by the system.

In conclusion, the assistant will generate the move list in the specified format, starting with the correct initial moves, following the iterative algorithm, and continue until the token limit is reached, ensuring that the format is strictly followed and any corrections are made as needed. The actual response will be truncated by the system, but the assistant's output must not self-truncate.
