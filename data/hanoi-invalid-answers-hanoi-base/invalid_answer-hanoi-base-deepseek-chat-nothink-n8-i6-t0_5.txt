Alright, let's tackle the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 8 disks. I'll approach this step by step, making sure to follow the rules and keep track of each move.

### Understanding the Problem

We have three pegs: Peg 0, Peg 1, and Peg 2. Initially, all 8 disks are on Peg 0, stacked from largest (disk 8 at the bottom) to smallest (disk 1 at the top). The goal is to move all disks to Peg 2, following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Only the top disk of a stack can be moved.
3. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

### Strategy

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive problem. The general strategy for moving `n` disks from a source peg to a target peg using an auxiliary peg is:

1. Move `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.
2. Move the `n-th` disk (the largest one) from the source peg to the target peg.
3. Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.

This strategy ensures that we never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one.

### Applying the Strategy to 8 Disks

Let's apply this step by step for 8 disks, where:
- Source peg (initial position): Peg 0
- Target peg (final position): Peg 2
- Auxiliary peg: Peg 1

We'll recursively break down the problem until we're moving single disks.

### Step-by-Step Moves

Here's how the moves will unfold. I'll list them in order, keeping track of which disks are being moved and between which pegs.
