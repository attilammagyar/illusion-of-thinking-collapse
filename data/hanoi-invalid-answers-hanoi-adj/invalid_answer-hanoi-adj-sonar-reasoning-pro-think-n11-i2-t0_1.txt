Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 11 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the standard rules. Since the optimal solution requires 2^11 - 1 = 2047 moves, this is going to be a long list. But the user insists on the full enumeration, so I need to generate it correctly.

First, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi problem is classically solved using recursion. The recursive approach involves moving the top n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, then moving the largest disk to the target peg, and finally moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg. However, implementing this recursively for 11 disks would generate the correct sequence, but manually writing out all 2047 steps isn't feasible. Instead, there's a pattern based on the parity of the number of disks.

From the search results, especially the Gray code method mentioned in [1], the solution can be derived by noting that each move corresponds to a bit change in a Gray code sequence. For each move, the disk to move is determined by the number of times the move number can be divided by 2. The direction to move the smallest disk depends on whether the total number of disks is odd or even. Since we have 11 disks (odd), the smallest disk (disk 1) cycles in the order 0 → 2 → 1 → 0 → 2 → 1, etc.

Another approach from the standard recursive solution: For an odd number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a cycle between pegs 0, 2, and 1. Each subsequent move alternates between moving the smallest disk and another valid move. However, keeping track of this manually for 2047 steps is error-prone.

Alternatively, the iterative approach involves repeating the following steps until all disks are moved:
1. Move the smallest disk to the next peg in the cycle (0→2→1→0 for odd disks).
2. Make the only valid move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

This pattern repeats until completion. Since 11 is odd, the cycle is 0→2→1→0...

Let me verify this with a smaller example. For 3 disks, the moves are:
1. Move 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move 1 from 0 to 2

Which matches the example provided. Applying this to 11 disks, each move alternates between moving disk 1 in the cycle and making the only other possible move.

To generate the sequence programmatically, I can simulate each move step by step. However, since I can't write code here, I need to find a pattern or formula that allows listing each move's disk, source, and destination.

Looking at the Gray code solution in [1], each move m (starting from 1) determines the disk to move by the number of times m can be divided by 2. For example, move 1: 1 divided by 2 once gives 0, so disk 1. Move 2: 2 divided by 2 once gives 1, so disk 2. Move 3: 3 divided by 2 once gives 1, so disk 1 again. This aligns with the example.

The direction for the smallest disk (disk 1) is determined by the parity of the total disks. For 11 (odd), the order is 0→2→1→0... So every time we move disk 1, it follows this cycle. For other disks, the move is determined by the only valid peg that doesn't place a larger disk on a smaller one.

Thus, the algorithm would be:
- For each move m from 1 to 2047:
   - Determine the disk to move: the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of m plus 1.
   - For disk 1, move it to the next peg in the cycle (0→2→1→0...).
   - For other disks, there's only one valid move between the other two pegs.

Implementing this requires tracking the current positions of all disks. Since manually tracking 11 disks over 2047 moves is impractical, I need a systematic way to generate each move.

Alternatively, using the recursive approach, the sequence can be built by decomposing the problem. For 11 disks, the steps would be:
1. Move 10 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2 as auxiliary.
2. Move disk 11 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move 10 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary.

Each of these steps is itself a Tower of Hanoi problem. Repeating this decomposition recursively generates the move list. However, enumerating all these steps manually is not feasible, but since the user requires the raw list, I must generate it correctly.

Given the constraints, the correct approach is to use the iterative method based on the Gray code solution, ensuring that each move follows the rules. Each move alternates between moving the smallest disk and the next valid move for the other disks.

However, without implementing an algorithm, I need to rely on known patterns. The minimal number of moves is 2047, and each move can be determined by the method described. Since the user insists on the complete list, I must generate it step by step, ensuring no errors.

But given the length, it's impossible to write out all 2047 moves here manually. However, perhaps there's a pattern in the move sequence that can be described in a loop-like structure, but the user requires the explicit list. Since the assistant is expected to output the full list, even if it's long, I must proceed.

Wait, the user mentioned that the output will be parsed automatically, so formatting isn't an issue. The assistant needs to generate the entire list correctly. Given that the Tower of Hanoi has a well-known optimal solution, the moves can be generated using the recursive or iterative method, and the sequence is deterministic.

Therefore, the correct move sequence for 11 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 is the standard optimal solution, which follows the recursive pattern. Each move can be generated by following the rules, alternating the smallest disk and the next available move.

Since the assistant can't compute this step-by-step here, but the search results mention the formula and methods, the correct answer is the sequence generated by the standard Tower of Hanoi solution for 11 disks, which results in 2047 moves. Each move alternates the smallest disk and the next possible move, following the cycle for odd disks.

Thus, the final answer is the complete list of 2047 moves in the specified format, generated according to the Tower of Hanoi's optimal solution.
