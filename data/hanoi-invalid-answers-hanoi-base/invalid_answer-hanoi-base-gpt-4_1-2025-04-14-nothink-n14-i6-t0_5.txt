Certainly! This is the classic **Tower of Hanoi** problem with 14 disks.

### Solution Approach

The optimal recursive solution is:

- Move the top \( n-1 \) disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.
- Move the largest disk (disk \( n \)) from the source peg to the target peg.
- Move the \( n-1 \) disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.

For \( n = 14 \), the moves are:

- Move disks 1–13 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary).
- Move disk 14 from peg 0 to peg 2.
- Move disks 1–13 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).

### Recursive Function

Here is a Python function that generates the moves in the required format:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, target, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, target, auxiliary, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, target, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(14, 0, 1, 2, moves)
```

### Complete List of Moves

The total number of moves for 14 disks is \( 2^{14} - 1 = 16,383 \).

**Due to the massive size, I will show the first few moves and explain how to generate all.**

#### First 10 Moves (as an example):

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    ...
]
```

#### How to Get the Full List

You can generate the full list in your environment using the code above. The list `moves` will contain **all 16,383 moves** in the required format:

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    ...
    [14, 0, 2],
    ...
    [1, 1, 2]
]
```

### Summary

- **Each move:** `[disk id, from peg, to peg]`
- **Order:** As in the standard Tower of Hanoi solution.
- **Total moves:** 16,383

If you want the entire list of moves (all 16,383), please let me know if you want it as a downloadable file or in another format, as it's too large to display directly here.
