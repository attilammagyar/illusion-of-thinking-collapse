Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 10 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation. First, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursion problem. The minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, so for 10 disks, that's 1023 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

The standard recursive approach is to move the top n-1 disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the target peg, and finally move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg. But since the user wants an explicit list, I need to generate each move step by step.

Looking at the search results, the iterative solution might be easier to implement here. The iterative method alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only valid move with a non-smallest disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Since 10 is even, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move in a consistent direction, maybe rightwards.

Wait, the Wikipedia article mentions that for an even number of disks, the smallest piece moves to the right. So each time we move disk 1, it goes to the next peg in a clockwise direction. Then, the next move is the only legal move possible with the non-smallest disk. Repeating this process until all disks are on the target peg.

Let me verify this with the example given. For 3 disks, the solution has 7 moves. The iterative approach would alternate between moving the smallest and the next possible disk. The example provided in the search results for 3 disks matches the standard solution.

So applying this to 10 disks, the process would be:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (since 10 is even, starting direction is right).
2. Make the only legal move with a non-smallest disk, which would be disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.
4. Next, move disk 1 again to the next peg (peg 0), then move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1.
5. Continue this pattern, alternating between moving the smallest disk and the next possible disk.

But generating all 1023 moves manually is impossible. However, there's a pattern to the moves that can be followed algorithmically. Each disk's moves follow a specific sequence based on its size. For example, disk 1 moves every other move, disk 2 moves every 4th move, and so on. The direction each disk moves depends on whether its position is even or odd.

Alternatively, using the recursive approach, the sequence can be generated by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. For 10 disks, the steps would be:

- Move 9 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2 as auxiliary.
- Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2.
- Move 9 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary.

Each of these steps would recursively break down further. But again, enumerating all these steps requires a systematic approach.

The search result [3] mentions the iterative solution's steps, which might be more straightforward to implement in code. However, since I need to generate the list here, I have to find a way to represent the moves correctly.

Another approach is to note that each move can be determined by the binary representation of the move number. For each move, the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move count. The direction is determined by the disk's size parity. But this might be complex to apply manually.

Alternatively, the iterative solution's steps can be followed:

- For even number of disks, the smallest disk moves right (0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0...).
- For each non-smallest move, there's only one legal move.

So, starting with peg 0 as source, peg 1 as auxiliary, peg 2 as target.

But with 10 disks, the target is peg 2. The iterative solution's end result depends on the parity. Wait, the Wikipedia article says that for an even number of disks, the stack ends up on peg B (which would be peg 1 in their example), but the user wants it on peg 2. Hmm, maybe the target needs to be adjusted.

Wait, the user's goal is to move all disks to peg 2. The standard iterative solution for even n ends up on peg B (peg 1), but perhaps the direction needs to be adjusted. Maybe the initial direction of the smallest disk should be different. Let me check.

In the Wikipedia section, it says that if the number of disks is even, the smallest disk moves to the right (A->B->C->A), and the stack ends up on peg C. Wait, no, the article says: "the stack will end up on peg B if the number of disks is odd and peg C if it is even." So for even n, the stack ends on peg C (which is peg 2 in our case). That matches the user's goal. So the iterative solution should work.

Therefore, following the iterative approach:

1. Always move the smallest disk to the next peg in a clockwise direction (0->1, 1->2, 2->0 for even n).
2. Then make the only legal move with the non-smallest disk.

Repeating these steps until all disks are on peg 2.

Now, to generate all the moves, I need to simulate this process. Let's outline the first few moves to see the pattern:

Move 1: Disk 1 from 0 to 1 (smallest move, clockwise)
Move 2: Disk 2 from 0 to 2 (only legal non-smallest move)
Move 3: Disk 1 from 1 to 2 (smallest move)
Move 4: Disk 3 from 0 to 1 (non-smallest move)
Move 5: Disk 1 from 2 to 0 (smallest move)
Move 6: Disk 2 from 2 to 1 (non-smallest move)
Move 7: Disk 1 from 0 to 1 (smallest move)
Move 8: Disk 4 from 0 to 2 (non-smallest move)
...

Continuing this pattern, each time the smallest disk moves clockwise, and the non-smallest move is determined by the only legal option.

But generating all 1023 moves manually is impractical. However, there's a pattern in the disk movements. Each disk moves in a cycle, and the direction depends on its size. For even-numbered disks, the direction is different from odd-numbered ones.

Alternatively, using the recursive approach, each disk's movement can be determined by its position in the recursion tree. For example, disk 1 moves every other move, disk 2 every four moves, etc.

But given the constraints, the user expects the complete CSV list. Since the search results include a video solving 10 disks [1][4], perhaps the moves can be generated based on that, but the actual move list isn't provided in the search results. Therefore, I need to rely on the algorithm.

The correct approach is to implement the iterative solution, ensuring that each move follows the rules. Since the user requires the complete list, I must generate each move step by step, ensuring no invalid moves.

However, given the token limit, generating all 1023 moves here might exceed the allowed output. But the user insists on not truncating, so I must proceed.

Let me start generating the moves step by step following the iterative method:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 1
2. Move 2 from 0 to 2
3. Move 1 from 1 to 2
4. Move 3 from 0 to 1
5. Move 1 from 2 to 0
6. Move 2 from 2 to 1
7. Move 1 from 0 to 1
8. Move 4 from 0 to 2
9. Move 1 from 1 to 2
10. Move 2 from 1 to 0
11. Move 1 from 2 to 0
12. Move 3 from 1 to 2
13. Move 1 from 0 to 1
14. Move 2 from 0 to 2
15. Move 1 from 1 to 2
16. Move 5 from 0 to 1
...

Continuing this pattern until all disks are moved. Each time, the smallest disk moves clockwise, and the non-smallest move is the only legal one. This will take 1023 moves. However, manually listing all here is impossible due to length, but the user insists, so I must proceed.

But wait, the user's note says that the output will be parsed automatically, and truncation risks a low score. Therefore, the assistant must output the complete list even if it's long. However, given the token limits, perhaps the assistant can generate the list programmatically. But since I can't run code, I have to find a way to represent the pattern.

Alternatively, the recursive solution can be represented as a series of moves. For n disks, the moves are:

- Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.
- Move nth disk from source to target.
- Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target.

Applying this recursively for each n.

For 10 disks, the first step is to move 9 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary. Then move disk 10 to peg 2. Then move 9 disks from peg 1 to peg 2.

Each of these steps involves breaking down into smaller problems. For example, moving 9 disks requires moving 8 disks first, and so on.

The challenge is to translate this recursive approach into an explicit list of moves. Each recursive call generates a sequence of moves. For 10 disks, the total moves are 2^10 -1 = 1023.

But generating this list requires a systematic approach. The standard solution for Tower of Hanoi can be generated using the following algorithm:

function hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print move disk 1 from source to target
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        print move disk n from source to target
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

Applying this for n=10, source=0, target=2, auxiliary=1.

This recursive function will generate the correct sequence. Each call to hanoi(n) generates 2^n -1 moves.

But again, listing all 1023 moves here is impractical manually. However, the user requires it, so perhaps the assistant can generate the list programmatically. Since I can't execute code, I must rely on the pattern.

Alternatively, the iterative approach's moves can be determined by the following rules:

- For even n, the smallest disk moves clockwise (0->1->2->0...)
- For each even move number (starting from 0), move the smallest disk.
- For each odd move number, make the only legal move not involving the smallest disk.

But implementing this requires tracking the state of each peg. However, given the complexity, the correct approach is to follow the recursive solution's move sequence.

Given that the user insists on the complete list, and the assistant's output must not truncate, I'll proceed to generate the moves using the recursive method, even though it's lengthy.

The first few moves for 3 disks are as given in the example. For 10 disks, the sequence would start with moving disk 1 back and forth, gradually moving larger disks. Each time a larger disk is moved, the smaller disks are rearranged around it.

However, without actual code, generating all 1023 moves accurately is error-prone. But perhaps the assistant can output the correct pattern-based list.

Alternatively, referring to the search result [4], which shows a 10-disk solution, but the transcript doesn't provide the move list. The video might have the solution, but the assistant can't watch it. Therefore, the assistant must rely on the algorithm.

In conclusion, the correct sequence of moves for 10 disks can be generated using the recursive method, resulting in 1023 moves. Each move follows the Tower of Hanoi rules, ensuring no larger disk is placed on a smaller one. The CSV list will start with moving disk 1 between pegs, followed by larger disks as they become available to move.
