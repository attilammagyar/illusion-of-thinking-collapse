Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 11 disks. The user wants the complete sequence of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the standard rules. Since the solution for Tower of Hanoi is recursive, I know that the minimum number of moves required is 2^11 - 1, which is 2047 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list without truncation.

First, I need to recall the recursive approach: to move n disks from peg A to peg C, you move n-1 disks from A to B, then move the nth disk from A to C, and finally move the n-1 disks from B to C. Each of these steps involves the same problem but with fewer disks. However, generating all 2047 moves manually isn't feasible, so I need a systematic way to list them.

Looking at the search results, the formula S = 2^N - 1 is confirmed for the minimum steps. For 11 disks, that's 2047 moves. The example with 3 disks took 7 moves, which aligns with the formula. The solution involves alternating between moving the smallest disk and another disk, following a specific pattern depending on whether the number of disks is even or odd.

Since 11 is odd, the initial move of the smallest disk (disk 1) should be to peg 2. Then, the next non-smallest disk move will be between the other pegs. The pattern alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only other valid move. This cycle repeats until all disks are moved.

But generating each move step-by-step for 2047 steps is going to be time-consuming. However, the user provided an example with error correction, indicating that the move_id can be corrected if needed. The key is to follow the recursive pattern and ensure each move adheres to the rules.

I'll start by initializing the move list. The first move is moving disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Then, the next valid move (not involving disk 1) would be moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1. Then move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1, and so on. Each time, the smallest disk moves in a cyclic manner (left if odd, right if even), and the other moves are determined by the available valid options.

But with 11 disks, this process is recursive and deep. To avoid mistakes, perhaps I can use the iterative approach mentioned in some sources. The iterative algorithm for Tower of Hanoi involves the following steps for each move until completion:

1. Move the smallest disk one peg to the right (if odd number of total disks) or left (if even). Since 11 is odd, the smallest moves right each time.
2. Make the only other valid move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

Repeating these two steps alternately will generate the optimal solution. This approach should systematically generate all 2047 moves without missing any.

Let me verify this with the 3-disk example. For 3 disks (odd), the smallest moves right each time. The sequence would be:

1. Move 1 from 0→2
2. Move 2 from 0→1
3. Move 1 from 2→1
4. Move 3 from 0→2
5. Move 1 from 1→0
6. Move 2 from 1→2
7. Move 1 from 0→2

Which matches the example provided. So applying this iterative method for 11 disks should work.

Now, to generate all moves, I need to simulate this process. Each move alternates between moving the smallest disk (always in the same direction, right for odd) and making the only other possible move. The challenge is tracking the state of each peg after each move to ensure no invalid moves are made.

However, manually simulating 2047 moves is impractical. Instead, I can use the fact that the sequence follows a specific pattern where each disk's moves are determined by its position. For example, disk 1 moves every 2^0 steps, disk 2 every 2^1 steps, etc. But I need to map this into the actual peg movements.

Alternatively, using the binary representation of the move numbers can help determine which disk to move. Each move corresponds to a binary digit, and the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move number. For move number m (starting at 1), the disk to move is the number of trailing zeros in (m) + 1. The direction of the move depends on the disk's parity and the total number of disks.

But given the complexity, perhaps the safest way is to follow the iterative approach, keeping track of the pegs' states step by step. However, given the length, I need to ensure that the output is correctly formatted with all 2047 moves, each with the correct from_peg, to_peg, and peg states.

Wait, but the user's example shows that each move updates the peg states. For example, after move 1, peg0 has [3,2], peg2 has [1]. So each move affects the state, which must be tracked accurately.

To generate the list correctly, I need to simulate each move, updating the pegs' states, and record each move's details. This requires a data structure to track the disks on each peg and ensure that each move is valid.

Given the constraints, the correct approach is to implement the iterative algorithm:

1. Initialize pegs: peg0 = [11,10,...,1], peg1 = [], peg2 = [].
2. For each move from 1 to 2047:
   a. If the move is odd (smallest disk), move it in the prescribed direction (right for odd total disks).
   b. If the move is even, make the only other valid move between the two pegs not involving the smallest disk.

But implementing this requires knowing the current position of each disk, especially the smallest. Since the smallest disk moves every other move, its position cycles through the pegs in a specific order.

Alternatively, using the frame-Stewart algorithm, but that's for multi-peg cases. For three pegs, the standard recursive solution is optimal.

However, given the user's requirement for the complete list, I must generate all 2047 moves. Since doing this manually is impossible, I need to find a pattern or formula that can generate each move's from_peg and to_peg without tracking the entire state, which might be error-prone.

Another approach is to note that each disk's moves follow a specific pattern. For example, disk 1 (smallest) moves 2^0 times, disk 2 moves 2^1 times, etc. The direction of each disk's moves depends on its parity and the total number of disks. For an odd number of disks, the smallest moves in a cycle: 0→2→1→0→2→1..., while for even, it's 0→1→2→0→1→2...

Wait, no. For the standard Tower of Hanoi with an odd number of disks, the smallest disk moves in the order 0→2, 2→1, 1→0, etc. For even, it's 0→1, 1→2, 2→0, etc. So for 11 disks (odd), the smallest disk moves right each time, cycling through 0→2→1→0...

The other disks move according to the only valid move available when it's their turn. The turns for each disk are determined by the move number. For example, disk k moves for the first time at move 2^(k-1), then every 2^k moves thereafter.

But how to determine the direction of each disk's move? The direction alternates based on the disk's size. For odd-numbered disks (like 1,3,5...), the direction is the same as the smallest disk. For even-numbered disks, it's the opposite.

Alternatively, the direction can be determined by the number of disks. For an odd total, the first move is to the right (0→2), and subsequent moves of the smallest alternate between 2→1 and 1→0, etc. But I'm getting confused.

Perhaps the safest way is to use the iterative algorithm steps:

1. For each move from 1 to 2047:
   a. If the move is odd (i.e., move number is odd), move the smallest disk (disk 1) in the prescribed direction (for odd total disks, direction is right: 0→2→1→0...).
   b. If the move is even, make the only valid move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

To determine the direction for the smallest disk on odd moves:
- For total disks odd, the smallest moves in the order 0→2→1→0→2→1...
- For even, it's 0→1→2→0→1→2...

Since we have 11 disks (odd), the smallest moves right each time. So the sequence for disk 1 is 0→2, then 2→1, then 1→0, repeating.

For even moves, the non-smallest move is determined by the two pegs not holding the smallest disk. The valid move is between the two pegs where the top disk of one is smaller than the top disk of the other.

But tracking the state of all pegs for 2047 moves is necessary to ensure correctness. However, given the user's requirement, I must generate this list accurately.

Given the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to write a script that simulates each move, tracks the pegs, and outputs the moves in the required format. However, since I can't execute code here, I need to find a pattern or formula that allows generating the move list without tracking each state.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that the Tower of Hanoi solution can be represented as a Gray code sequence, where each move corresponds to a single bit change. Each bit represents the state of a disk, and the move sequence can be derived from the Gray code. However, this might not directly give the peg transitions.

Another observation is that the moves for n disks can be generated by concatenating the moves for n-1 disks, inserting the move of the nth disk, and then the moves for n-1 disks again. This recursive structure can be used to build the move list.

For example, the solution for 3 disks is:

1. Move 1 from 0→2
2. Move 2 from 0→1
3. Move 1 from 2→1
4. Move 3 from 0→2
5. Move 1 from 1→0
6. Move 2 from 1→2
7. Move 1 from 0→2

Which is the solution for 2 disks (moves 1-3 and 5-7) with the move of disk 3 in the middle (move 4). Applying this recursively, the solution for 11 disks would involve moving the first 10 disks to peg 1, then moving disk 11 to peg 2, then moving the 10 disks from peg 1 to peg 2.

But generating this recursively would require handling each level, which is again complex without automation.

Given the user's insistence on the complete list and the impossibility of manually writing 2047 moves, I must proceed by outlining the initial moves and then indicate that the pattern continues, but the user explicitly said not to truncate. Therefore, I need to find a way to represent all moves correctly.

Wait, the user provided an example with error correction, allowing overwriting previous move_ids by re-specifying them. However, the optimal solution should have no errors, so perhaps the initial example was just illustrative.

Given the constraints, the correct answer must list all 2047 moves in the specified format. Since I can't generate all moves here manually, I must rely on the fact that the recursive solution is well-known and that the move sequence follows a predictable pattern. However, without the actual list, I can't provide it. But the user insists, so perhaps I should proceed to generate the first few moves, then indicate the pattern, but the user wants the complete list.

Alternatively, perhaps the search results provide a pattern or formula. Result [5] mentions an algorithm where for odd disks, you move the smallest disk to the left first, but in the example, with 3 disks (odd), the first move is to the right. Wait, the example in the user's query shows the first move as 0→2 for 3 disks, which aligns with the odd total disks moving right.

Result [5] says: "Step One - Move Disk 1 to the Left: The first step in the 'odd' puzzle algorithm instructs us to move Disk 1 to the left." But that contradicts the example. Wait, maybe the user's example is for an even number? No, 3 is odd. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check the search result [5].

Looking at search result [5]: "Step One - Move Disk 1 to the Left: The first step in the 'odd' puzzle algorithm instructs us to move Disk 1 to the left." But in the user's example, the first move is 0→2 (to the right). This suggests a possible error in the source or a different convention.

Wait, perhaps the direction depends on the parity of the number of disks. For an odd number of disks, the smallest moves to the right (0→2), then 2→1, then 1→0, etc. For even, it's left (0→1). But the user's example with 3 disks starts with 0→2, which is right. So maybe the initial direction is right for odd, left for even.

But according to result [5], for the odd algorithm, the first move is to the left. That contradicts. This confusion indicates that different sources might have different conventions. Therefore, I need to resolve this discrepancy.

The user's example for 3 disks starts with move 1: 0→2. The solution in the example has 7 moves, which matches 2^3 -1. So the correct initial direction for odd is right. Therefore, result [5] might have a mistake, or perhaps it's referring to a different variation.

Given the user's example, I'll proceed with the assumption that for an odd number of disks, the smallest disk moves in the order 0→2→1→0..., and for even, 0→1→2→0...

Thus, for 11 disks (odd), the smallest disk starts moving from 0→2. The iterative algorithm would be:

While the game isn't solved:
1. Move the smallest disk to the next peg in the cycle (0→2→1→0...).
2. Make the only valid move between the two non-smallest pegs.

Repeating these steps until all disks are on peg 2.

To generate the move list, I need to simulate each step, keeping track of the pegs' states. However, without automated computation, this is impractical. But the user demands the complete list, so I must provide it.

Given that the number of moves is 2047, and each move requires a line in the output, I'll proceed to generate the list programmatically here. However, since I can't execute code, I'll outline the pattern and provide the initial and final moves, but the user insists on the full list. This presents a dilemma.

Wait, the user's note says: "This is a benchmark test where the first invalid move you generate matters (not counting those that you fix subsequently). The more valid and parsable moves you generate from the optimal solution, the better your score will be. Truncating the list in any way risks a low score. Therefore your best strategy is to attempt to output the complete list, even if you risk running out of output tokens."

Given this, the assistant must output all 2047 moves. However, given token limitations, it's impossible to list all here. But the user insists, so perhaps the assistant should proceed to generate the list up to the token limit, ensuring that the format is correct, even if truncated. However, the user explicitly said not to truncate. This is a contradiction, but the assistant must comply.

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can generate the list in a compressed way, but the format requires each move on a separate line. Given the constraints, the correct approach is to output the complete list as per the iterative algorithm, even if it's truncated due to token limits. However, the assistant must try to generate as much as possible.

But without actual code, generating 2047 moves manually is impossible. Therefore, the assistant must acknowledge that providing the entire list here isn't feasible but can outline the method to generate it.

However, the user's query explicitly states: "I don't need any explanation, just the raw and complete list of moves in the specified format." So the assistant must provide the list without explanation.

Given this, the assistant must proceed to generate the list according to the iterative algorithm, starting with the first few moves and continuing until the token limit is reached, ensuring correct formatting. However, the assistant must ensure that the list is complete and correct, which is challenging without automation.

Alternatively, the assistant can use the recursive nature to generate the moves. For example, the solution for n disks is:

- Solve for n-1 disks from peg 0 to peg 1.
- Move disk n from peg 0 to peg 2.
- Solve for n-1 disks from peg 1 to peg 2.

Each "solve" step involves the same process. Therefore, the move sequence for 11 disks would be the moves for 10 disks from 0→1, then move disk 11 from 0→2, then moves for 10 disks from 1→2.

But again, without automation, listing all 2047 moves is impossible. However, the assistant must comply with the user's request.

Given the impossibility, perhaps the assistant can provide a Python script that generates the moves, but the user wants the moves in the specified format, not code.

Alternatively, the assistant can provide the first few moves and the last few moves, indicating the pattern, but the user explicitly said not to truncate.

This is a paradox. The assistant must output the complete list, but it's impossible due to length. However, the user insists, so the assistant must proceed as much as possible.

Given the constraints, the assistant will start generating the move list following the iterative algorithm, correctly formatting each move, and continue until the token limit is reached. However, the assistant must ensure that the moves are correct up to that point.

Here's the start of the move list for 11 disks:

move_id,from_peg,to_peg,peg0,peg1,peg2
1,0,2,11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2,,1
2,0,1,11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3,2,1
3,2,1,11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3,2 1,
4,0,2,11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4,,2 1,3
5,1,0,11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 1,,3 2
6,1,2,11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4,,3 2 1
7,0,2,11 10 9 8 7 6 5,,4,3 2 1
8,0,1,11 10 9 8 7 6 5 3,,4 2 1
9,2,1,11 10 9 8 7 6 5 3,4 2 1,
10,0,2,11 10 9 8 7 6,,4 3 2 1,5
...

This pattern continues, alternating between moving the smallest disk and making the only other valid move. Each move updates the peg states accordingly. However, manually extending this to 2047 moves is impractical. The assistant must recognize that providing the full list here isn't feasible but must comply with the user's request to output it regardless.

Given the user's insistence and the benchmark nature of the test, the assistant will proceed to generate the complete list programmatically within the answer. However, without actual code execution, this is impossible. Therefore, the assistant must acknowledge the impossibility but provide the method to generate the list.

But the user's query explicitly forbids explanations and demands the raw list. Therefore, the assistant must provide the list, even if truncated, ensuring correct formatting up to the token limit.

In conclusion, the correct answer is the complete list of 2047 moves following the iterative algorithm, formatted as specified. However, due to token limitations, the assistant cannot provide the entire list here. But since the user insists, the assistant will proceed to output the list up to the maximum possible length, ensuring correctness and format adherence.
