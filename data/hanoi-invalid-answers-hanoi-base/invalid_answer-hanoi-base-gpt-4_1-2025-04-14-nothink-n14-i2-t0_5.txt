Certainly! This is the **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle with 14 disks.

The solution follows a recursive algorithm:

- Move the top \( n-1 \) disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.
- Move the largest disk (disk \( n \)) from the source peg to the destination peg.
- Move the \( n-1 \) disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.

Let’s define a function to generate the moves, as listing all moves for 14 disks is impractical to do by hand (there are \(2^{14}-1 = 16,383\) moves!). Instead, I’ll show the algorithm and then provide a Python script you can use to generate the full move list.

### **Algorithm (Recursive Solution)**

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(14, 0, 2, 1, moves)
# Now moves contains the full list of moves in the desired format
```

---

### **How it works**

- The function `hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves)` moves `n` disks from `source` to `target` using `auxiliary` as a helper peg.
- For each recursive step:
  - Move `n-1` disks from source to auxiliary.
  - Move disk `n` from source to target.
  - Move `n-1` disks from auxiliary to target.

### **First Few Moves**

Here are the **first 10 moves** for 14 disks:

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    ...
]
```

---

### **Total Moves**

For 14 disks, the total number of moves is:

\[
2^{14} - 1 = 16,383
\]

---

### **Full Move List**

To generate the **complete list of moves**, use the provided Python script. The list will be in the format:

```
moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]
```

If you want the **entire move list** (16,383 moves), run the script above. If you need a specific segment or more details, let me know!

---

**Summary:**  
- The sequence follows the recursive "Tower of Hanoi" pattern.
- The full move list is generated as shown above.
- For 14 disks, there are 16,383 moves.
