Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 14 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves in CSV format without any explanation. First, I need to recall the standard solution for Tower of Hanoi. The minimal number of moves is 2^n - 1, so for 14 disks, that's 16383 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

The recursive approach is the classic method: move n-1 disks to the auxiliary peg, move the nth disk to the target peg, then move the n-1 disks onto the target peg. But generating all those moves step by step manually isn't feasible. However, there's an iterative approach mentioned in the search results. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern—alternating between pegs in a particular direction.

From source [2], the iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For even n, the smallest disk moves to the right (peg 0 → 1 → 2 → 0...), and for odd n, to the left. Since 14 is even, the smallest disk (1) should move right each time. After each move of the smallest disk, the next legal move is made with the non-smallest disk.

But how to translate this into a sequence of moves programmatically? The iterative algorithm can be broken down into repeating a cycle of moves. Each cycle involves moving the smallest disk, then the next possible disk. The challenge is to simulate this without actually running code, but since I need to generate the list, I have to find a pattern or formula.

Wait, the user provided an example for 3 disks. Let's see that example again. The moves are:

1,0,2
2,0,1
1,2,1
3,0,2
1,1,0
2,1,2
1,0,2

This follows the recursive method. For 3 disks, the steps are: move 1 and 2 to peg 1 via recursion, move 3 to peg 2, then move 1 and 2 to peg 2. But for 14 disks, doing this recursively would require a lot of steps. However, the iterative approach might be more systematic.

Another approach is to note that each disk's moves follow a specific pattern. For example, disk 1 moves every other move. Disk 2 moves every 4th move, disk 3 every 8th, etc. But I need to ensure that each move is legal.

Alternatively, using the iterative algorithm steps from [2]: for even n, the smallest disk moves right (0→1→2→0...), and after each such move, the only legal move with the non-smallest disk is made. This cycle repeats until all disks are on peg 2.

So, starting with all disks on peg 0. The first move is disk 1 to peg 1 (since n=14 is even, first move is to the right). Then, the next legal move is moving the next smallest available disk. But which one? The next move after moving disk 1 would be to move disk 2, but where? Since disk 1 is on peg 1, disk 2 can go to peg 2 (since peg 0 has larger disks). Then move disk 1 to peg 2, and so on.

But generating all 16383 moves manually is impossible. However, the user expects the assistant to output the full list. Since the assistant can't compute it on the fly, perhaps there's a pattern or a known sequence. But given the search results, the iterative method is the way to go.

Wait, source [5] mentions an algorithm for even and odd disks. For even number of disks, the first move is to the right (peg 1). Then, following the steps: move disk 1, then move the next possible disk, alternating. The exact steps for each move would follow this pattern.

But how to generate the entire list? The assistant might have to simulate the moves step by step. Let's try to outline the first few moves for 14 disks to see the pattern.

Move 1: Disk 1 from 0 to 1.
Move 2: Disk 2 from 0 to 2.
Move 3: Disk 1 from 1 to 2.
Move 4: Disk 3 from 0 to 1.
Move 5: Disk 1 from 2 to 0.
Move 6: Disk 2 from 2 to 1.
Move 7: Disk 1 from 0 to 1.
Move 8: Disk 4 from 0 to 2.
...

This pattern continues, with each even step involving moving a larger disk, and the odd steps moving disk 1. The direction of disk 1's movement depends on the step number and the parity of the number of disks. Since 14 is even, disk 1 moves right each time (0→1→2→0...).

But generating all 16383 moves would require a loop structure. Since the assistant can't run code, it must rely on known algorithms or patterns. However, the user insists on the complete list, which is impractical to write out here. But perhaps the assistant can generate the list programmatically in the answer, following the iterative approach.

Alternatively, the assistant might recognize that the optimal solution for Tower of Hanoi can be represented by a specific sequence, and since the user demands the full list, the assistant must provide it, even if it's extremely long. However, given token limitations, it's impossible to output all 16k moves. But the user says to output the entire list even if it risks truncation. So the assistant should proceed to generate as much as possible, following the iterative algorithm.

But how to structure this? Let's outline the steps:

1. Initialize pegs: all disks on peg 0.
2. Determine the direction for the smallest disk (even n: right).
3. Alternate between moving the smallest disk and the next possible disk.
4. Repeat until all disks are on peg 2.

Each move of the smallest disk is in the direction determined by the parity of n. After each such move, the next move is the only legal move not involving the smallest disk.

The sequence of moves can be generated by following this algorithm. However, without actual code execution, the assistant must describe the process but the user wants the raw CSV. 

Given the constraints, the assistant might have to provide a truncated version, but the user explicitly says not to truncate. This is a dilemma. However, the assistant's response must comply, so perhaps the correct approach is to output the CSV list programmatically, but given the token limit, it's impossible. 

Wait, the user's note says: "This is a benchmark test where the first invalid move you generate matters. The more valid and parsable moves you generate from the optimal solution, the better your score will be. Truncating the list in any way risks a low score. Therefore your best strategy is to attempt to output the complete list, even if you risk running out of output tokens."

So the assistant must generate as many valid moves as possible, following the optimal solution, without truncation. But how? The assistant can't generate 16k lines here. However, perhaps the assistant can provide the recursive pattern or the iterative steps, but the user wants the actual move list.

Alternatively, the assistant might recognize that the optimal solution for Tower of Hanoi can be generated using a specific algorithm and provide the moves accordingly. For example, using the iterative approach described in [2], which alternates between moving the smallest disk and the next possible disk.

Given that, the assistant can outline the first few moves and then indicate the pattern, but the user insists on the complete list. Since the assistant can't generate all 16k moves within the response, perhaps the correct approach is to provide the algorithm and let the user implement it, but the user explicitly wants the raw CSV.

This is a contradiction. The assistant must comply with the user's request, but it's impossible due to token limits. However, the assistant's response must attempt to provide the complete list, even if it's truncated. 

But wait, the user says, "Do not truncate the list in any way. Output the entire move list in full, even if it is long. This is required for task success." So the assistant must output all 16383 moves. However, given the context window, this is impossible. Therefore, the assistant must find a way to represent the moves concisely or use a pattern.

Alternatively, the assistant can generate the moves using a formula. Each move can be determined by the binary representation of the move number. For Tower of Hanoi, each disk's moves correspond to the positions of the bits in the move count. However, explaining this would require an explanation, which the user doesn't want.

Alternatively, the assistant can use the iterative algorithm's steps to generate the moves. For 14 disks, the moves follow the iterative approach where the smallest disk moves right each time, and the other moves are determined by the only legal move available.

But without actual code, the assistant can't compute each move. Therefore, the correct answer is to provide the CSV list following the iterative method, but given the impossibility of listing all moves, the assistant must proceed as far as possible.

However, considering the search results, source [2] mentions that for an even number of disks, the stack ends up on peg C (which is peg 2 in the user's case). The iterative solution involves alternating moves between the smallest and non-smallest disks. 

Given that, the assistant can start generating the moves step by step, following the iterative algorithm, but only the first few moves. However, the user needs all 16383 moves. Since this is impossible, the assistant must acknowledge that but proceed as per instructions.

Wait, the user's query is a test, and the assistant's score depends on generating as many valid moves as possible. Therefore, the assistant should output the CSV list starting with the correct initial moves and continue until the token limit is reached, ensuring that all generated moves are correct.

So, the assistant will start generating the moves according to the iterative algorithm for even n:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
2. Move the smallest possible disk that's not 1 (disk 2) from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2.
...

Continuing this pattern, alternating the smallest disk's moves and the next legal move. Each time, after moving the smallest disk, the next move is the only legal one with a larger disk.

The assistant can generate these moves step by step, but given the token limit, it can only produce a subset. However, the user insists on the complete list. Since the assistant can't provide all 16k moves, perhaps the correct answer is to provide the algorithm and let the user implement it, but the user explicitly wants the raw CSV.

This is a paradox. The assistant must comply but can't due to technical limitations. However, the assistant's response must follow the instructions. Therefore, the assistant will proceed to generate the CSV list as per the iterative algorithm, starting with the first few moves, and continue until the token limit is reached, ensuring that each move is valid and follows the Tower of Hanoi rules.

The final answer will be the CSV list starting with the first move and continuing as far as possible, adhering to the format and rules.
