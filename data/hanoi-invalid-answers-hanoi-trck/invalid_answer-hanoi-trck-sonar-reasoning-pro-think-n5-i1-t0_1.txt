Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves in the specified format without any truncation. First, I remember that the minimum number of moves required for n disks is 2^n - 1. For 5 disks, that's 31 moves. So the solution should have exactly 31 steps.

Looking at the search results, result [4] confirms that 5 disks need 31 steps. The example given for 3 disks in the user's query shows a specific format, so I need to replicate that structure. The PDF in result [1] seems to list a sequence of numbers, possibly representing disk movements. However, it's a bit unclear. The YouTube videos in results [2] and [3] might demonstrate the solution, but since I can't watch them, I'll rely on the textual information.

Result [5] mentions an algorithm for solving the Tower of Hanoi, focusing on moving the smaller disks repeatedly. The key is the recursive nature: move n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, move the largest disk to the target peg, then move the n-1 disks onto the largest. For 5 disks, this would involve moving the top 4 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, moving disk 5 to peg 2, then moving the 4 disks from peg 1 to peg 2.

But how to translate this into the specific move list? Each move needs to be recorded with move_id, from_peg, to_peg, and the state of each peg after the move. The example provided uses a CSV-like format. Let's start building the sequence step by step.

Starting with all disks on peg 0: [5,4,3,2,1], [], [].

Move 1: Disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Now peg0: [5,4,3,2], peg2: [1].

Move 2: Disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1. Peg0: [5,4,3], peg1: [2].

Move 3: Disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1. Now peg1: [2,1].

Move 4: Disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2. Peg0: [5,4], peg2: [3].

Move 5: Disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0. Peg0: [5,4,1], peg1: [2].

Move 6: Disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2. Peg2: [3,2].

Move 7: Disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Peg2: [3,2,1].

Move 8: Disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 1. Peg0: [5], peg1: [4].

Move 9: Disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1. Peg1: [4,1].

Move 10: Disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 0. Peg0: [5,2], peg2: [3].

Move 11: Disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0. Peg0: [5,2,1], peg1: [4].

Move 12: Disk 3 from peg 2 to peg 1. Peg1: [4,3], peg2: [].

Move 13: Disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Peg2: [1], peg0: [5,2].

Move 14: Disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1. Peg1: [4,3,2], peg0: [5].

Move 15: Disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1. Peg1: [4,3,2,1].

Move 16: Disk 5 from peg 0 to peg 2. Now peg2: [5], peg0: empty.

Move 17: Disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0. Peg0: [1], peg1: [4,3,2].

Move 18: Disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2. Peg2: [5,2], peg1: [4,3].

Move 19: Disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Peg2: [5,2,1].

Move 20: Disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 0. Peg0: [3], peg1: [4].

Move 21: Disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1. Peg1: [4,1], peg2: [5,2].

Move 22: Disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 0. Peg0: [3,2], peg2: [5].

Move 23: Disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0. Peg0: [3,2,1], peg1: [4].

Move 24: Disk 4 from peg 1 to peg 2. Peg2: [5,4], peg1: empty.

Move 25: Disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Peg2: [5,4,1], peg0: [3,2].

Move 26: Disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1. Peg1: [2], peg0: [3].

Move 27: Disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1. Peg1: [2,1].

Move 28: Disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2. Peg2: [5,4,3], peg0: empty.

Move 29: Disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0. Peg0: [1], peg1: [2].

Move 30: Disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2. Peg2: [5,4,3,2], peg1: empty.

Move 31: Disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Peg2: [5,4,3,2,1], which is the goal.

Now, I need to format each move with the correct peg states. Let's verify each step to ensure no larger disk is placed on a smaller one. For example, move 4 moves disk 3 to peg 2, which is empty, so that's fine. Move 5 moves disk 1 to peg 0, which has disk 5 and 4, so it's okay. Each subsequent move follows the rules. The final configuration should have all disks on peg 2 in order. This matches the required 31 moves. The search results mention the 31 steps, so this aligns with [4]. The example in the user's query for 3 disks uses a similar pattern, so applying the same logic for 5 disks should work.

The above solution follows the standard Tower of Hanoi algorithm with 31 moves required for 5 disks[4]. Each move adheres to the puzzle's rules, transferring disks between pegs while maintaining proper size ordering. The sequence demonstrates the recursive pattern of moving smaller stacks to temporary pegs to enable larger disk movements.
