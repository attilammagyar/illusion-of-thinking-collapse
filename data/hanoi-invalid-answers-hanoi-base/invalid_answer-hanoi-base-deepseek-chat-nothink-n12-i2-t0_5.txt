Alright, let's tackle the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 12 disks. I'll approach this step by step, ensuring that at each move, we're following the rules: only moving one disk at a time, never placing a larger disk on top of a smaller one, and only moving the top disk of any stack.

### Understanding the Problem

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive problem. The general strategy for moving `n` disks from the starting peg (let's call it peg A) to the destination peg (peg C) using an auxiliary peg (peg B) is as follows:

1. Move `n-1` disks from peg A to peg B using peg C as auxiliary.
2. Move the nth disk (the largest one) from peg A to peg C.
3. Move the `n-1` disks from peg B to peg C using peg A as auxiliary.

This recursive approach ensures that we're always moving disks in a way that doesn't violate the rules.

### Applying to 12 Disks

Given that we have 12 disks initially on peg 0, and we want to move them all to peg 2, using peg 1 as auxiliary, we'll follow the recursive method. Here's how the sequence would unfold:

1. Move the top 11 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary).
2. Move the 12th disk (the largest) from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move the 11 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).

Each of these steps (like moving 11 disks) will be broken down further recursively until we're moving single disks.

### Generating the Moves

Given the recursive nature, the total number of moves required is `2^n - 1`, which for `n=12` is `4095` moves. That's a lot! Instead of listing all 4095 moves here (which would be impractical), I'll outline the general approach and provide the first few and last few moves to illustrate the pattern.

However, since the requirement is to provide the complete list of moves, I'll describe how one would generate them programmatically or recursively, and then provide a sample of the moves.

### Recursive Algorithm for Moves

Here's how the moves can be generated recursively in Python-like pseudocode:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n > 0:
        # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
        # Move the nth disk from source to target
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        # Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to target
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)
```

Initial call would be `hanoi(12, 0, 2, 1, moves)` where `moves` is an empty list that gets populated.

### Sample Moves

Given the enormity of the sequence, here's the beginning and end of the move sequence:

**First few moves:**
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 1
   ...

**Last few moves:**
...
4090. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
4091. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2
4092. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
4093. Move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 0
4094. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
4095. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 0
4096. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0

Wait a minute, that doesn't seem right. For 12 disks, the total moves should be 4095, not 4096. Let me correct the last few moves:

After moving the largest disk (12) to peg 2, we then move the remaining 11 disks from peg 1 to peg 2. The last few moves would involve moving the smallest disks to finally place disk 1 on top of the stack on peg 2.

Here's the corrected last few moves:

...
4089. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
4090. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1
4091. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
4092. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2
4093. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
4094. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2
4095. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2

Now, disk 1 is on top of the complete stack on peg 2.

### Complete Move Sequence

Given the impracticality of listing all 4095 moves here, the complete sequence can be generated by implementing the recursive algorithm provided above in a programming language like Python. Here's how the complete sequence starts and ends:

**Initial moves:**
```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [5, 0, 2],
    ...
]
```

**Final moves:**
```
    ...
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [3, 1, 0],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [4, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2]
]
```

### Verifying the Number of Moves

For `n` disks, the minimum number of moves required is `2^n - 1`. For `n=12`:
`2^12 - 1 = 4096 - 1 = 4095` moves.

Our sequence should have exactly 4095 moves when generated completely.

### Conclusion

The complete sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi with 12 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 involves 4095 moves following the recursive pattern described. Here's how the sequence starts and ends:

**First few moves:**
```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [5, 0, 2],
    ...
]
```

**Last few moves:**
```
    ...
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [3, 1, 0],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [4, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2]
]
```

For the exact full list, one would need to implement the recursive algorithm or use an iterative approach to generate all 4095 moves systematically. 

### Final Answer

Given the constraints of this format, here's the complete list of moves for the first few and last few steps, with the understanding that the middle moves follow the recursive pattern:

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [5, 0, 2],
    ...
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [3, 1, 0],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [4, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2]
]
```

*Note: The "..." represents the continuation of the pattern for all 4095 moves. To get the exact full sequence, implementing the recursive algorithm is recommended.*
