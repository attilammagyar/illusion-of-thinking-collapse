Let's break down the **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle for 14 disks.

### **How the Solution Works**
The classic recursive solution for Tower of Hanoi with \( n \) disks and three pegs is:
1. Move \( n-1 \) disks from source peg to auxiliary peg.
2. Move the largest disk to the target peg.
3. Move the \( n-1 \) disks from auxiliary peg to target peg.

Each move is of the form: `[disk id, from peg, to peg]` (disk id: 1 is smallest, 14 is largest).

### **Recursive Algorithm**
Let’s define a function:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 0:
        return
    hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
    moves.append([n, source, target])
    hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)
```

To solve your puzzle:

```python
moves = []
hanoi(14, 0, 2, 1, moves)
```

### **Output**
The total number of moves for 14 disks is \( 2^{14} - 1 = 16,383 \).

#### **First 10 Moves**
Here are the first 10 moves (for illustration):

```
[1, 0, 2]
[2, 0, 1]
[1, 2, 1]
[3, 0, 2]
[1, 1, 0]
[2, 1, 2]
[1, 0, 2]
[4, 0, 1]
[1, 2, 1]
[2, 2, 0]
```

#### **Full Move List**
The full list has 16,383 moves. Here’s how you can generate it in Python:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 0:
        return
    hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
    moves.append([n, source, target])
    hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(14, 0, 2, 1, moves)
print(moves)  # This will print the complete move list
```

### **Summary**
- **Total moves:** 16,383
- **Move format:** `[disk id, from peg, to peg]`
- **First few moves:** (see above)
- **Complete move list:** Use the code above to generate.
