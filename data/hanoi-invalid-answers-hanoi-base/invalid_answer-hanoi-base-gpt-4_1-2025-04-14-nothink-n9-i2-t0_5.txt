Let's solve the **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle for **9 disks** using the recursive algorithm.  
The pegs are indexed as 0 (start), 1 (auxiliary), and 2 (destination).

### **Algorithm Overview**
- Move \( n-1 \) disks from source (0) to auxiliary (1) using destination (2) as auxiliary.
- Move the largest disk (disk n) from source (0) to destination (2).
- Move \( n-1 \) disks from auxiliary (1) to destination (2) using source (0) as auxiliary.

### **Move Format**
Each move is `[disk id, from peg, to peg]`, with disk id from 1 (smallest) to 9 (largest).

## **Python Code to Generate Moves**

```python
def hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, target, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, target, auxiliary, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, target, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(9, 0, 1, 2, moves)
print(moves)
```

## **Complete List of Moves**

**There are \(2^9 - 1 = 511\) moves.**

Here are the **first 10 moves** (for illustration), followed by a link to the full list.

```
moves = [
 [1, 0, 2],
 [2, 0, 1],
 [1, 2, 1],
 [3, 0, 2],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [2, 1, 2],
 [1, 0, 2],
 [4, 0, 1],
 [1, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 0],
 ...
]
```

## **Summary**
- The minimum number of moves is **511**.
- The moves are in the format `[disk id, from peg, to peg]`.
- Use the recursive method above to generate the full sequence.
