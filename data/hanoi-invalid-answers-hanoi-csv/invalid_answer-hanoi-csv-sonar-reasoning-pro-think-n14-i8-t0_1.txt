Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 14 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's 14 disks, which is an even number, I remember from the search results that the iterative solution might involve moving the smallest disk in a specific direction each time. 

The Wikipedia article mentioned that for an even number of disks, the smallest disk should move to the right initially. The iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and another valid move. Each time, the smallest disk moves in the same direction (right for even, left for odd). So for 14 disks, the first move should be disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1, then the next non-smallest disk move.

But generating all 2^14 - 1 = 16383 moves manually is impossible. However, the user insists on the complete list. Since the solution is recursive, maybe I can use the recursive approach to generate the moves. The standard recursive solution for Tower of Hanoi is: to move n disks from A to C, move n-1 disks from A to B, then move the nth disk from A to C, then move n-1 disks from B to C. But implementing this recursively would require a function that outputs each move step by step.

Alternatively, the iterative approach from the search results says to alternate between moving the smallest disk and making the only other valid move. For even n, the smallest disk moves right (peg 0→1→2→0...), and for each non-smallest move, there's only one possible move that doesn't place a larger disk on a smaller one.

Given that 14 is even, the smallest disk (1) starts moving to peg 1, then peg 2, then peg 0, etc. Each time after moving the smallest, the next move is the only legal move possible with the remaining disks. 

But how to translate this into a step-by-step list? The iterative algorithm steps are:

1. Move the smallest disk in the correct direction (right for even n).
2. Make the only other possible move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.
3. Repeat until all disks are on the target peg.

Since the user wants the complete list, I need to simulate this process. However, manually writing out 16k moves isn't feasible here. But perhaps there's a pattern or a way to generate the sequence programmatically. 

Wait, the search result [2] mentions the iterative solution's steps. For even n, the stack ends up on peg C. The solution involves alternating between moving the smallest and then the only possible non-smallest disk. Each cycle consists of moving the smallest, then another disk. 

But without writing code, how can I generate the sequence? Maybe there's a pattern in the moves. For example, the moves for the smallest disk follow a cycle, and the other moves are determined by the state. However, given the constraints, the assistant must output the entire list. 

But since the assistant can't compute it here, perhaps the answer is to provide the standard recursive solution's move list. However, generating 16383 moves would exceed the response length. The user acknowledges that but insists on the full list. 

Alternatively, maybe the assistant can provide the moves in a compressed way, but the user specified CSV format. Given the note that the output will be parsed automatically, the assistant must output the full list. 

But given the token limit, it's impossible to list all 16k moves here. However, the user insists, so perhaps the assistant proceeds to generate as much as possible, following the iterative algorithm steps, even if truncated. But the user says not to truncate. This is a dilemma. 

Wait, the search result [2] says the minimal number of moves is 2^14 -1 = 16383. The assistant must output all of them. But how? The only way is to recognize that the solution follows a specific pattern and can be generated algorithmically. However, without executing code, the assistant can't list each move. 

But perhaps the assistant can provide the iterative algorithm's steps in code form, which the user can run to generate the moves. However, the user wants the raw list, not code. 

Alternatively, the assistant might use the recursive approach to generate the moves. Let's outline the recursive solution:

To move n disks from A to C using B:
- If n == 1, move disk 1 from A to C.
- Else:
  - Move n-1 disks from A to B using C.
  - Move disk n from A to C.
  - Move n-1 disks from B to C using A.

Applying this recursively for 14 disks would generate the correct sequence. Each move can be determined by this recursion. 

But again, listing all 16383 moves here is impractical. However, the user insists, so the assistant must proceed. 

Given that, the assistant might start generating the moves step by step, following the recursive pattern. However, due to token limits, the assistant can't output all 16k lines. But the user's note says to output the entire list even if it risks truncation. So the assistant should proceed as far as possible. 

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can provide a Python script that generates the moves, but the user wants the CSV list, not code. 

This is a challenging situation. The correct answer is the sequence of 16383 moves following the Tower of Hanoi recursive solution. But given the constraints, the assistant must output the list. However, realistically, it's impossible here. 

But perhaps the assistant can provide the first few moves and the last few, indicating the pattern, but the user explicitly said not to truncate. 

Wait, the user's note says: "Do not truncate or summarize the moves. Output the entire move list in full, even if it is long. This is required for task success." So the assistant must output all 16383 moves. 

Given that, the assistant must find a way to generate them. However, without actual computation, it's impossible. Therefore, the assistant must acknowledge that generating all moves here isn't feasible but provide the method to generate them. However, the user insists on the raw list. 

This is a paradox. The correct answer is the full list, but it's too long. The assistant must comply, so perhaps the answer is to provide the recursive solution's moves in CSV format, even if it's truncated by the system. 

Alternatively, the assistant can use the iterative algorithm's steps to generate the moves. Let's try to outline the first few moves for 14 disks:

1. Since n=14 (even), the smallest disk moves to the right (peg 0→1→2→0...).

Move 1: disk 1 from 0 to 1.

Next, move the only possible non-smallest disk, which is disk 2 from 0 to 2.

Move 2: disk 2 from 0 to 2.

Then move disk 1 from 1 to 2.

Move 3: disk 1 from 1 to 2.

Next, move disk 3 from 0 to 1.

Move 4: disk 3 from 0 to 1.

Then move disk 1 from 2 to 0.

Move 5: disk 1 from 2 to 0.

Move disk 2 from 2 to 1.

Move 6: disk 2 from 2 to 1.

Move disk 1 from 0 to 1.

Move 7: disk 1 from 0 to 1.

Move disk 4 from 0 to 2.

And so on. Each time, after moving the smallest disk, the next move is determined by the only possible legal move. 

This pattern continues, with the smallest disk moving right each time, and the other moves following. However, manually listing all 16383 moves is impossible here. 

Therefore, the assistant must acknowledge that providing the full list isn't feasible in this context but provide the method to generate it. However, the user's instructions explicitly demand the full list. 

Given the constraints, the assistant must proceed to output the CSV list as per the recursive solution, even if it's truncated by the system. The correct answer is the full list, so the assistant will start generating it, knowing that it might be cut off but complying with the user's request.
