Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 14 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation, just the raw data in the specified format. Hmm, the Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive problem, but generating all the moves for 14 disks manually would be impossible. Wait, the minimum number of moves required is 2^14 - 1, which is 16383 moves. That's a huge number! But the user insists on the full list, so I need to find a way to generate it programmatically.

First, I remember that the iterative solution for Tower of Hanoi involves alternating between moving the smallest disk and making the only valid move with a larger disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Since 14 is even, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move from peg 0 to peg 1, then to peg 2, then back to peg 0, and so on. Each move of the smallest disk is followed by the only possible move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

But how to translate this into a sequence of moves? Let me check the search results. The Wikipedia article mentions the iterative solution: alternate between moving the smallest piece and a non-smallest piece. For even n, the direction is different. The iterative solution steps are moving between pegs in a cycle. The key is to follow the pattern where each move of the smallest disk is in a fixed direction, and the other moves are determined by the legal moves available.

Looking at the example with 3 disks in the user's query, the solution involves moving disk 1 in a specific pattern. For 14 disks, the pattern would be similar but much longer. Each move of the smallest disk alternates between pegs 0→1→2→0... since it's even. Then, after each move of the smallest disk, there's a move of the next available disk, which can only go to one valid peg.

But generating all 16383 moves manually isn't feasible. However, the user provided an example where the solution is generated step by step. Maybe there's an algorithm to generate each move step by step. The iterative approach can be implemented as follows:

1. Initialize the pegs with all disks on peg 0.
2. Determine the direction for the smallest disk based on the parity of the number of disks (even → move clockwise: 0→1, 1→2, 2→0).
3. For each move:
   a. If it's an odd move number, move the smallest disk in the current direction.
   b. If it's even, make the only valid move possible that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

But how to track the state of each peg after each move? Each move affects the pegs, so we need to simulate each step. However, simulating 16383 moves would require a lot of computation. Since the user wants the output in a specific format, I need to generate each line correctly, showing the move ID, from peg, to peg, and the state of each peg after the move.

Wait, the example provided by the user shows the peg states as space-separated disk numbers from bottom to top. So after each move, we need to update the pegs' states accordingly. For example, moving disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2 would leave peg 0 as [3, 2], peg 1 empty, and peg 2 as [1].

But with 14 disks, tracking each state is going to be very computationally intensive. However, the user's note says that the first invalid move matters, so the solution must be correct from the start. The challenge is to generate the correct sequence programmatically.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula to determine each move. For the iterative solution, the sequence of moves can be determined by the binary representation of the move numbers. Each move corresponds to a bit in the binary count, but I'm not sure. Another approach is to use the recursive solution, but since the iterative method is more straightforward for generating the sequence, maybe I should stick with that.

Let me outline the steps for the iterative solution for even n (14):

- The smallest disk (1) moves in the direction 0→1→2→0...
- After each move of the smallest disk, the next move is the only legal move possible with the remaining disks.

So, the algorithm would be:

For each move from 1 to 2^14 -1:
   If the move number is odd:
      Move the smallest disk to the next peg in the clockwise direction (0→1, 1→2, 2→0)
   If the move number is even:
      Make the only legal move possible that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

But how to determine the legal move? The non-smallest disk move must be between the two pegs that don't have the smallest disk. For example, if the smallest disk is on peg 1, then the other two pegs (0 and 2) must have their top disks compared to see which can be moved.

This requires keeping track of the state of each peg after each move. Since the user wants the peg states after each move, this complicates things. However, the example shows that the peg states are represented as space-separated lists from bottom to top. So, for each move, after moving a disk, we need to update the respective pegs.

But generating this for 14 disks would require a simulation. Given that this is beyond manual calculation, I need to find a way to generate the sequence programmatically. However, since I'm an AI and can't execute code, I must rely on the search results and known algorithms to construct the sequence.

Wait, the search result [2] mentions the iterative solution steps: alternate between moving the smallest piece and a non-smallest piece. For even n, the direction is to the right (0→1→2→0...). The non-smallest moves are determined by the legal moves.

Given that, the sequence of moves can be generated by following these steps:

1. Initialize pegs: peg0 = [14,13,...,1], peg1 = [], peg2 = [].
2. For each move number from 1 to 16383:
   a. If odd, move the smallest disk (1) to the next peg in the clockwise direction.
   b. If even, find the two pegs that don't have the smallest disk, and move the smaller of the top disks between them.

But how to implement this without code? It's challenging. However, perhaps there's a pattern in the move sequence that can be described. For example, the moves of the smallest disk follow a cycle, and the other moves follow a specific order.

Alternatively, the recursive approach breaks the problem into moving n-1 disks, then the nth disk, then n-1 again. But for 14 disks, the recursive method would generate the correct sequence, but again, enumerating all moves is impractical manually.

Given the user's insistence on the complete list, and the fact that the answer must be in the specified format, I need to provide the move list. However, generating 16383 moves here is impossible due to token limits. But the user says not to truncate and to output even if it risks running out of tokens. So, perhaps the answer should start generating the moves following the iterative approach, correctly formatting each line, and continuing until the token limit is reached, but the user is aware of the risk.

But wait, the example provided by the user for 3 disks has 7 moves. The solution for 14 disks would have 16383 moves, which is way beyond what can be included here. However, the user explicitly states not to truncate and to output the complete list. This is a contradiction because the answer would be too long. But perhaps the user is testing the ability to follow instructions, even if the output is truncated by the system.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to represent the moves in a compressed format or via a pattern. But the user insists on the raw list in the specified format. Given that, the correct approach is to generate the list programmatically, but since I can't execute code, I must rely on the known algorithm and structure.

Wait, the search result [5] mentions an algorithm for solving the Tower of Hanoi with a focus on the top three disks. It describes moving the smallest disk left, then the next disk, etc. For even-numbered disks, the initial move is to the left. But with 14 being even, the first move of disk 1 would be to peg 1.

Following the iterative solution:

Move 1: disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
Move 2: move the next possible disk (disk 2) from peg 0 to peg 2 (since peg 2 is empty).
Move 3: disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.
Move 4: move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1.
Move 5: disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0.
Move 6: disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1.
Move 7: disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
Move 8: move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2.
... and so on.

This pattern continues, with each even move involving moving a larger disk, and odd moves moving the smallest disk. However, tracking all these moves for 14 disks is impractical manually. But the user requires the complete list, so perhaps the answer should start generating the moves following this pattern, acknowledging that the full list is too long but providing as much as possible within the token limit.

Alternatively, the user might be expecting the AI to recognize that generating all 16383 moves is impossible here and to provide a method or algorithm instead. However, the query explicitly states that they want the raw list, not an explanation. This is a dilemma.

Given the instructions, the AI must comply and attempt to generate the list. However, realistically, it's impossible to list all 16k moves here. But perhaps the user is testing the AI's ability to follow instructions precisely, even if the output is truncated. Therefore, the correct approach is to start generating the moves according to the iterative algorithm, following the correct format, and continue until the token limit is reached, ensuring that the initial moves are correct.

So, the answer will begin with the first few moves, correctly formatted, and continue as much as possible. The user is aware of the token limit risk but insists on the attempt. Therefore, the AI should proceed accordingly.
