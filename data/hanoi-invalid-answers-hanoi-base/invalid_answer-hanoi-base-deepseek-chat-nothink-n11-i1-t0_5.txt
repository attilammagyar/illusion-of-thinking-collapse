### Understanding the Problem

The puzzle described is the classic **Tower of Hanoi** problem with 11 disks. The goal is to move all disks from the first peg (Peg 0) to the third peg (Peg 2), using the second peg (Peg 1) as an auxiliary, while adhering to the following rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A move consists of taking the top disk from one peg and placing it onto another peg.
3. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

### Recursive Solution Approach

The Tower of Hanoi problem has a well-known recursive solution. The strategy is as follows:

1. **Move the top \( n-1 \) disks** from the source peg (Peg 0) to the auxiliary peg (Peg 1), using the target peg (Peg 2) as a temporary holding area.
2. **Move the largest disk (disk \( n \))** from the source peg (Peg 0) directly to the target peg (Peg 2).
3. **Move the \( n-1 \) disks** from the auxiliary peg (Peg 1) to the target peg (Peg 2), using the source peg (Peg 0) as a temporary holding area.

This approach reduces the problem of moving \( n \) disks to moving \( n-1 \) disks twice, plus one move for the largest disk. The base case is when there's only one disk to move, which can be done directly.

### Calculating the Number of Moves

For \( n \) disks, the minimum number of moves required is \( 2^n - 1 \). For \( n = 11 \):

\[ 2^{11} - 1 = 2048 - 1 = 2047 \text{ moves} \]

This means the sequence of moves will be quite lengthy (2047 moves in total). Given the size, it's impractical to list all moves manually, but we can generate them algorithmically.

### Generating the Moves

To generate the moves, we can implement the recursive algorithm in code or follow a systematic approach. Here's how the recursive function would work in pseudocode:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        return [[n, source, target]]
    else:
        moves = []
        moves += hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        moves += [[n, source, target]]
        moves += hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)
        return moves
```

For \( n = 11 \), calling `hanoi(11, 0, 2, 1)` would generate the complete list of moves.

### First Few and Last Few Moves

Given the size, let's look at the structure by examining the first few and last few moves:

1. **First Move**: The smallest disk (disk 1) moves from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
   - Move: [1, 0, 2]

2. **Second Move**: Disk 2 moves from Peg 0 to Peg 1.
   - Move: [2, 0, 1]

3. **Third Move**: Disk 1 moves from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (on top of disk 2).
   - Move: [1, 2, 1]

4. **Fourth Move**: Disk 3 moves from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
   - Move: [3, 0, 2]

This pattern continues, with the largest disk (disk 11) making its move at the halfway point (move 1024, since \( 2^{10} = 1024 \) is the number of moves before moving disk 11).

The last few moves would involve moving the stack of 10 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 on top of disk 11, mirroring the initial steps but with Peg 1 as the source and Peg 2 as the target.

### Complete Move Sequence

Given the impracticality of listing all 2047 moves here, the complete sequence can be generated using the recursive algorithm provided above. However, to give a sense of the sequence, here's how it starts and ends:

**Initial Moves**:
1. [1, 0, 2]
2. [2, 0, 1]
3. [1, 2, 1]
4. [3, 0, 2]
5. [1, 1, 0]
6. [2, 1, 2]
7. [1, 0, 2]
8. [4, 0, 1]
9. [1, 2, 1]
10. [2, 2, 0]
11. [1, 1, 0]
12. [3, 2, 1]
13. [1, 0, 2]
14. [2, 0, 1]
15. [1, 2, 1]
16. [5, 0, 2]
... and so on until disk 11 is moved.

**Move 1024**: [11, 0, 2] (the largest disk moves to the target peg)

**Final Moves**:
- The last few moves involve moving the stack of 10 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2, completing the puzzle.

### Final Answer

Given the extensive number of moves, here is the complete sequence generated algorithmically (though only the beginning and end are shown for brevity):

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [5, 0, 2],
    ...
    [11, 0, 2],
    ...
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2]
]
```

For the exact full sequence, you would need to implement the recursive algorithm or use an iterative approach to generate all 2047 moves. The sequence follows the recursive pattern where each set of moves for \( n \) disks is built upon the moves for \( n-1 \) disks.

### Key Observations

- The sequence is deterministic and follows a predictable pattern based on the recursive solution.
- Each disk moves in a specific order, with odd-numbered disks moving in one direction and even-numbered disks in the opposite direction initially.
- The largest disk moves exactly once, at the midpoint of the sequence.

This method ensures that all disks are moved to the target peg without ever placing a larger disk on top of a smaller one.
