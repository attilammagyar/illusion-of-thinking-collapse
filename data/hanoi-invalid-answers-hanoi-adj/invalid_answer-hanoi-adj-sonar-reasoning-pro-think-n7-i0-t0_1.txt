Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to move all disks from peg 0 to peg 2. The rules are the standard ones: only move one disk at a time, no larger disks on smaller ones. And they insist on the full list without truncation. Alright, let's think.

First, I remember that the minimum number of moves for n disks is 2^n - 1. For 7 disks, that's 127 moves. So the solution should have exactly 127 moves. The challenge is generating each move correctly in order.

The Tower of Hanoi problem is classically solved using recursion. The recursive approach involves moving the top n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, then moving the nth disk to the target peg, and then moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg. But since the user wants an explicit list, I need to translate that recursive logic into a step-by-step sequence.

Alternatively, there's an iterative approach. From the search results, the iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only valid move with another disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Wait, 7 is odd. The search result [4] mentions that for an odd number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a particular direction. Let me check.

In the iterative solution described in [4], when the number of disks is odd, the smallest piece moves to the next peg in a left direction (since the starting number is odd). But the exact movement pattern might vary. The key is alternating between moving the smallest disk and the only possible non-smallest disk move.

But how to translate that into the exact sequence? Maybe there's a pattern to the moves. Let's think about smaller cases. For example, with 3 disks, the moves are:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move 1 from 0 to 2

Which matches the example given. For 7 disks, the pattern would be similar but much longer. Each time, the smallest disk (1) moves in a cycle. For odd n, the direction might be different. Wait, according to [4], for an odd number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a circular manner: 0→2→1→0..., but I need to confirm.

Alternatively, the iterative approach steps are:

- Move the smallest disk to the next peg in a specific direction (left or right depending on parity).
- Then make the only possible move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

Repeating these two steps until all disks are moved. For 7 disks (odd), the direction for the smallest disk might be to the right each time. Wait, the search result [2] mentions that for even numbers, the movement is reversed. Let me check [2]: "if your starting tower has an even number of disks you'll need to use the alternate 'Even' algorithm." So for 7 disks (odd), the movement of disk 1 is to the left each time. But the pegs are 0,1,2. Moving left from 0 would be to peg 2 (since it's a circular arrangement?), or maybe it's a different direction.

Wait, the search result [4] says: "When moving the smallest piece, always move it to the next position in the same direction (to the right if the starting number of pieces is even, to the left if the starting number of pieces is odd). If there is no tower position in the chosen direction, move the piece to the opposite end, but then continue to move in the correct direction."

So for 7 disks (odd), the direction is to the left. So starting at peg 0, moving left would go to peg 2 (since 0-1 is left? Or maybe the direction is considered as a cycle). Wait, maybe the direction is considered as a cycle. For example, moving left from peg 0 would go to peg 1, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, the direction could be in a circular manner. Let me think again.

The iterative solution in [4] says: "move the smallest piece to the next position in the same direction (to the right if the starting number of pieces is even, to the left if the starting number of pieces is odd)." So for odd n (7), the direction is left. So each time you move the smallest disk, you move it to the left. But what's left? If the current peg is 0, left would be peg 1? Or is it a circular arrangement where left from 0 is 2? Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the example in [4] for 3 disks (odd) starts with moving disk 1 from 0 to 2. Then the next move is disk 2 from 0 to 1. Then disk 1 from 2 to 1. Then disk 3 from 0 to 2. Then disk 1 from 1 to 0. Then disk 2 from 1 to 2. Then disk 1 from 0 to 2. So the movement of disk 1 is 0→2→1→0→2→1→0→2. Wait, that seems like moving in a left direction? Or maybe it's a cycle of 0→2→1→0... So for odd n, the direction is left, which in this case is a cycle of 0→2→1→0, etc.

So for each move of the smallest disk, it moves in the order 0→2→1→0→2→1... So the direction is left, which in the 3-peg setup is a circular left. So from 0, left is 2, then from 2, left is 1, then from 1, left is 0, etc.

Therefore, for 7 disks (odd), the smallest disk moves in the sequence 0→2→1→0→2→1... alternating each time. Then, after each move of the smallest disk, the next move is the only possible legal move with the remaining disks.

So the algorithm would be:

1. Move the smallest disk (1) to the next peg in the left direction (0→2→1→0...).
2. Make the only possible move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.
3. Repeat until all disks are on peg 2.

Following this pattern, we can generate all 127 moves.

But how to translate this into the exact sequence for 7 disks? Manually generating this would be time-consuming, but since the user wants the list, perhaps there's a pattern or a known sequence.

Looking at the search results, [1] is a video solution for 7 disks. The description says it's the simplest and most optimum solution. However, without watching the video, I can't see the exact moves. Similarly, [3] is another video tutorial for 7 disks. But again, I can't access the video content.

Search result [2] provides a step-by-step for a 7-disk puzzle. Let's look at that. The user provided a snippet from [2]:

"How to Solve a Seven-Disk Tower of Hanoi Puzzle · Step One - Move Disk 1 to the Left · Step Two - Move Disk 2 · Step Three - Move Disk 1 to the Left · Step Four - ... This completes the circle of movement and would once again allow Disk 1 to move left onto the middle peg and then back onto the leftmost peg again, ready to jump back around to the rightmost peg and start the sequence again. Of course, for puzzles with an Even number of disks the movements would be reversed but would follow the same pattern. Disk 1 would jump from the leftmost peg to the right, landing on the middle peg. From the middle peg it would move right onto the rightmost peg, and then back around to the leftmost peg again to complete the circular sequence.... After finishing Step 8, the first application of the algorithm is complete. To continue the solution, the odd algorithm must once again be performed in its entirety. Move Disk 1 to the left, move Disk 2, move Disk 1 to the left again, move Disk 3, move Disk 1 to the left for the third time, move disk 2, move Disk 1 to the left and finally move the next Big Disk (in this case it's the Light-Blue disk). The graphic above shows the board after the second run-through of the algorithm so you'll be able to verify that your technique is correct. Now that you've got the hang of it, continue to apply the algorithm until your Tower of Hanoi puzzle is completely solved. Of course, if your starting tower has an even number of disks you'll need to use the alternate 'Even'"

From this, it seems that for odd disks (7), the algorithm involves moving disk 1 to the left each time, then moving the next available disk. The steps are:

- Move disk 1 left.
- Move the next possible disk (the smallest possible that can be moved).
- Repeat.

But the exact sequence would require following this pattern 127 times. However, manually generating this is impractical. Instead, perhaps there's a recursive way to generate the moves.

The recursive solution for Tower of Hanoi is:

To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:

1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.
2. Move nth disk from source to target.
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target.

Applying this recursively, each move can be generated. For 7 disks, this would generate the correct sequence.

Let's try to outline the moves for 7 disks using recursion.

The base case is n=1: move disk 1 from source to target.

For n=2:

1. Move 1 from source to auxiliary.
2. Move 2 from source to target.
3. Move 1 from auxiliary to target.

For n=3:

1. Move 1 from source to target.
2. Move 2 from source to auxiliary.
3. Move 1 from target to auxiliary.
4. Move 3 from source to target.
5. Move 1 from auxiliary to source.
6. Move 2 from auxiliary to target.
7. Move 1 from source to target.

But for n=7, this would involve a lot of steps. However, the pattern is consistent. Each time, the moves alternate between moving smaller disks and the next largest.

The challenge is to translate this recursive approach into the exact sequence of moves for 7 disks. Since the user wants the list, perhaps the best way is to generate it programmatically. But since I can't execute code here, I need to rely on known patterns or existing solutions.

Looking at the example given in the problem statement for 3 disks, the moves are:

[[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2]]

Which follows the recursive approach. Let's see:

- Move 1 from 0 to 2 (step 1 of moving 2-1 disks from source to auxiliary)
- Move 2 from 0 to 1 (step 2: move disk 2 to target)
- Move 1 from 2 to 1 (step 3: move 1 disk from auxiliary to target)
- Then move 3 from 0 to 2 (step 2 of the main problem)
- Then move 1 from 1 to 0 (part of moving the 2 disks from auxiliary to target)
- Move 2 from 1 to 2
- Move 1 from 0 to 2

So for 7 disks, the sequence would follow the same recursive pattern but with more layers. Each time a larger disk is moved, it's preceded and followed by the moves of the smaller disks.

But generating this manually is error-prone. However, given that the minimum number of moves is 127, and the example for 3 disks has 7 moves (2^3 -1), the pattern is clear.

Another approach is to note that the moves for the Tower of Hanoi can be represented using a binary reflected Gray code, where each move corresponds to a single bit change. Each disk's moves alternate between two pegs based on its position. However, this might be more complex.

Alternatively, the iterative approach can be followed step by step. Let's try to outline the first few moves for 7 disks using the iterative method.

Since 7 is odd, the smallest disk (1) moves in a left direction. Starting at peg 0:

Move 1: Move disk 1 from 0 to 2 (left direction, since 0→2 is left in a circular sense? Or maybe left is peg 1? Wait, this is confusing. According to the example in [4], for 3 disks (odd), the first move is disk 1 from 0 to 2. Then next move is disk 2 from 0 to 1. Then disk 1 from 2 to 1. So the direction for disk 1 is 0→2→1→0→2→1... So left direction here is moving in the order 0→2→1→0...

So for each move of disk 1, it alternates between pegs in the order 0→2→1→0→2→1...

So the sequence for disk 1's moves would be:

Move 1: 0→2

Move 3: 2→1

Move 5: 1→0

Move 7: 0→2

And so on.

Between each of these, we have to make the only possible move that doesn't involve disk 1.

So after moving disk 1 to 2, the next move is the only possible one, which is moving the next smallest disk (2) from 0 to 1 (since disk 2 can't go on top of disk 1 on peg 2). Then move disk 1 from 2 to 1. Then move disk 3 from 0 to 2. Then move disk 1 from 1 to 0. Then move disk 2 from 1 to 2. Then move disk 1 from 0 to 2. Then move disk 4 from 0 to 1. And so on.

This pattern continues, with each even-numbered move involving a non-1 disk, and the odd-numbered moves moving disk 1 in the left direction.

Following this pattern, we can generate all 127 moves. However, manually listing them all is impractical, but since the user insists, I need to find a way to represent this.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a known sequence for 7 disks. The search result [1] and [3] are videos showing the solution, but I can't watch them. However, the problem is standard, and the optimal solution is well-known.

Given that the recursive approach generates the correct sequence, and the example for 3 disks follows it, I can use the recursive method to generate the moves.

The recursive function for Tower of Hanoi can be represented as follows:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}")
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}")
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

For n=7, source=0, target=2, auxiliary=1.

Each call to hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target) moves the top n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using target as the auxiliary peg. Then the nth disk is moved from source to target. Then the n-1 disks are moved from auxiliary to target using source as the auxiliary.

Translating this into the sequence of moves, each move of a disk is logged. For 7 disks, this would generate 127 moves.

But how to get the exact list without coding? Well, perhaps I can outline the pattern.

The order of moving disks follows a specific pattern where each disk moves every 2^(disk-1) steps. For example, disk 1 moves every 1 step, disk 2 every 2 steps, disk 3 every 4 steps, etc.

But to list all 127 moves, I need to follow the recursive breakdown.

Alternatively, the sequence can be generated using the binary representation of the move numbers. Each move corresponds to a binary digit, and the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation plus one. The direction depends on the disk's parity.

But this might be more complex. However, for the sake of generating the correct sequence, perhaps this is the way to go.

Another approach is to note that the moves for each disk follow a specific pattern. For example, disk 1 moves in every odd-numbered move: 1, 3, 5, ..., 127. The direction alternates between pegs based on the disk's position.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to recognize that the recursive solution will generate the correct sequence and that the moves for 7 disks can be derived from that.

Therefore, the complete list of moves for 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the recursive algorithm, is a sequence of 127 moves. Each move alternates between moving smaller disks and the next available larger disk, following the Tower of Hanoi rules.

Since the user requires the complete list and the note says that truncation risks a low score, I must provide all 127 moves. However, manually writing them all is impossible here. But perhaps there's a pattern or a known list.

Alternatively, referring back to the search result [4], which states that the minimum number of moves is 2^7 -1 = 127, and the example for 3 disks is correct, I can infer that the recursive approach will generate the correct sequence.

Therefore, the answer is the list of moves generated by the recursive algorithm for 7 disks, moving from peg 0 to peg 2 with peg 1 as auxiliary.

The exact sequence would be:

moves=[[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2],[4,0,1],[1,2,1],[2,2,0],[1,1,0],[3,2,1],[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[5,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2],[3,1,0],[1,2,1],[2,2,0],[1,0,2],[4,1,2],[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2],[6,0,1],[1,2,1],[2,2,0],[1,0,2],[3,2,1],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2],[4,2,0],[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2],[5,2,1],[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2],[4,0,1],[1,2,1],[2,2,0],[1,0,2],[3,2,1],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2],[7,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2],[3,1,0],[1,2,1],[2,2,0],[1,0,2],[4,1,2],[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2],[5,1,0],[1,2,1],[2,2,0],[1,0,2],[3,2,1],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2],[4,2,0],[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2],[6,1,2],[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2],[4,0,1],[1,2,1],[2,2,0],[1,0,2],[3,2,1],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2],[5,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2],[3,1,0],[1,2,1],[2,2,0],[1,0,2],[4,1,2],[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2]]

But wait, this is just an example for the first few moves. To generate all 127 moves, I need to follow the recursive pattern. However, without the ability to compute it here, I must rely on existing resources.

The search result [2] mentions a step-by-step for a 7-disk puzzle, but the provided snippet doesn't include the full list. However, it describes the algorithm as moving disk 1 left, then the next disk, etc., repeating the pattern.

Given that the user insists on the full list and the note about parsing, I must provide the complete sequence. However, manually listing 127 moves is impractical. But perhaps there's a pattern that can be followed.

Alternatively, considering that the problem is a benchmark and the user needs the exact list, perhaps the answer is the standard optimal solution for 7 disks, which can be found in references. Since the search results include videos and guides, but I can't access them, I have to rely on the recursive approach.

In conclusion, the correct sequence of moves is the one generated by the recursive Tower of Hanoi algorithm for 7 disks, moving from peg 0 to peg 2 with peg 1 as the auxiliary. This results in 127 moves, following the pattern of moving smaller disks recursively to free up larger ones.
