Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 9 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's 9 disks, the minimum number of moves should be 2^9 - 1, which is 511 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list without truncation.

First, I need to recall the standard solution for Tower of Hanoi. The recursive approach is to move the top n-1 disks from the source to the auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the target peg, and finally move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary to the target. But since the user wants an iterative solution, maybe the iterative approach is better here, especially for generating the step-by-step moves.

Looking at the search results, the Wikipedia entry mentions an iterative solution where you alternate moves between the smallest disk and a non-smallest disk. For an odd number of disks (9 is odd), the smallest disk moves in a cyclic manner to the right (peg 0 → 1 → 2 → 0...). Each non-smallest move is the only legal move available. 

The example given in the search results for 3 disks shows a specific pattern. Let's see if that pattern scales. For 3 disks, the moves are 7 steps. For 9 disks, it's 511 steps. The key is to follow the iterative algorithm strictly.

Another point from the search results: the Chess and Poker site mentions an algorithm where you move Disk 1 (smallest) to the left if the number of disks is odd. Wait, but the Wikipedia says for odd disks, the smallest moves to the right? Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy. Let me check.

Wait, the Chess and Poker site says for the "odd" algorithm, move Disk 1 to the left each time. But Wikipedia's iterative solution says for an even number of disks, the smallest moves to the right, and for odd, to the left. Wait, no—actually, the Wikipedia entry states: "When moving the smallest piece, always move it to the next position in the same direction (to the right if the starting number of pieces is even, to the left if the starting number of pieces is odd)." So for 9 disks (odd), the smallest moves to the left each time. But pegs are 0,1,2. Moving left from 0 would be to peg 2 (since it's cyclic). Wait, maybe the direction is considered as a cycle. So moving left from peg 0 would go to peg 2, then next left to peg 1, etc. Or maybe it's a circular arrangement where moving right is 0→1→2→0, and left is 0→2→1→0.

This is crucial. Let me clarify. If the number of disks is odd, the smallest disk moves in a left direction (e.g., 0→2, 2→1, 1→0, etc.), and if even, to the right (0→1, 1→2, 2→0). So for 9 disks, each move of the smallest disk is to the next peg in the left direction.

The iterative algorithm alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only legal move possible with the remaining disks. So every odd-numbered move is the smallest disk, moving left. Then the next move is the only possible move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

To generate all 511 moves, I need to simulate this process step by step. Since doing this manually is impossible, I need to find a pattern or a way to generate each move correctly.

Alternatively, the recursive approach can be converted into an iterative one by understanding the pattern of moves. For each disk, the number of times it's moved is 2^(disk number -1). For example, disk 1 (smallest) moves every other move, disk 2 moves every 4 moves, etc. But this might not directly help in listing all moves.

Another approach is to use the binary representation of the move numbers. Each move corresponds to a bit in binary, but I'm not sure how that translates here.

Wait, the iterative solution from Wikipedia says:

For an odd number of disks:

- Move the smallest disk cyclically to the left (0→2, 2→1, 1→0, etc.).
- Make the only legal move that does not involve the smallest disk.

Repeat these two steps until done.

So the steps would be:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
2. Make the only legal move not involving disk 1, which is moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
... and so on.

This pattern continues, with the smallest disk moving left each time, and the other moves being determined by the only possible legal move.

Given that, I can try to generate the sequence step by step. However, with 511 moves, this is going to be extremely tedious. But since the user requires the full list, I need to find a way to output it correctly.

Looking at the example provided in the user's query for 3 disks, the move sequence is:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move 1 from 0 to 2

Which follows the iterative approach. For 9 disks, the same pattern applies but with more layers.

The challenge is to generate all 511 moves correctly, ensuring that each move follows the rules and that the peg states are accurately tracked after each move.

Since manually generating this is impractical, I need to rely on the algorithm's structure. Each move of the smallest disk alternates with the only possible move of the next available disk. The key is to simulate this process.

Let me outline the steps for the first few moves to see the pattern:

Move 1: Move disk 1 from 0 to 2 (smallest disk moves left)
Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2
Peg1: empty
Peg2: 1

Move 2: Move the next possible disk (disk 2) from 0 to 1 (only legal move not involving disk 1)
Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3
Peg1: 2
Peg2: 1

Move 3: Move disk 1 from 2 to 1 (smallest disk moves left again, which from peg2 would go to peg1)
Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3
Peg1: 2 1
Peg2: empty

Move 4: Move disk 3 from 0 to 2 (next available move not involving disk1)
Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5 4
Peg1: 2 1
Peg2: 3

Move 5: Move disk1 from 1 to 0 (smallest disk moves left from peg1 to peg0)
Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5 4 1
Peg1: 2
Peg2: 3

Move 6: Move disk2 from 1 to 2 (only legal move not involving disk1)
Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5 4 1
Peg1: empty
Peg2: 3 2

Move7: Move disk1 from 0 to 2 (smallest moves left from 0 to 2)
Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5 4
Peg1: empty
Peg2: 3 2 1

Move8: Move disk4 from 0 to 1 (next available move)
Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5
Peg1:4
Peg2:3 2 1

Move9: Move disk1 from 2 to 1 (smallest moves left from 2 to 1)
Peg0:9 8 7 6 5
Peg1:4 1
Peg2:3 2

Move10: Move disk2 from 2 to 0 (only legal move)
Peg0:9 8 7 6 5 2
Peg1:4 1
Peg2:3

Move11: Move disk1 from 1 to 0 (smallest moves left from 1 to 0)
Peg0:9 8 7 6 5 2 1
Peg1:4
Peg2:3

Move12: Move disk3 from 2 to 1 (next move)
Peg0:9 8 7 6 5 2 1
Peg1:4 3
Peg2: empty

Move13: Move disk1 from 0 to 2 (smallest moves left from 0 to 2)
Peg0:9 8 7 6 5 2
Peg1:4 3
Peg2:1

Move14: Move disk2 from 0 to 1 (only legal move)
Peg0:9 8 7 6 5
Peg1:4 3 2
Peg2:1

Move15: Move disk1 from 2 to 1 (smallest moves left from 2 to 1)
Peg0:9 8 7 6 5
Peg1:4 3 2 1
Peg2: empty

Move16: Move disk5 from 0 to 2 (next move)
Peg0:9 8 7 6
Peg1:4 3 2 1
Peg2:5

... and this continues, with each layer requiring more steps. The pattern is that every time a larger disk is moved, it's part of the recursive step to build the tower on the target peg.

Given the complexity, the correct approach is to simulate the iterative algorithm, tracking the state of each peg after each move. However, generating all 511 moves manually is impossible here. Instead, I need to rely on the known optimal solution and structure the moves accordingly.

The search result [4] mentions that the minimum number of moves is 2^9 -1 = 511, which aligns with the user's requirement. The example in [1] shows a 9-disk solution, but the transcript doesn't provide the exact move list. However, the iterative approach is the way to go.

To ensure correctness, each move of the smallest disk alternates direction (left for odd number of disks), and the other moves are determined by the only legal option. This must be followed meticulously.

Since the user insists on the complete list without truncation, I must generate all 511 moves. However, given the token limitations, it's possible that the full list can't be provided here. But the user emphasizes that truncation risks a low score, so I need to attempt it.

Given the constraints, I'll proceed to generate the move list following the iterative algorithm, ensuring each move adheres to the rules and correctly updates the peg states. Each line will be formatted as per the requirements, with move_id, from_peg, to_peg, and the state of each peg after the move.

Starting with the initial state:

Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
Peg1: 
Peg2: 

Move 1: Move disk 1 from peg0 to peg2 (smallest disk moves left)
Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2
Peg1: 
Peg2: 1

Move 2: Move disk 2 from peg0 to peg1 (only legal move not involving disk1)
Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3
Peg1: 2
Peg2: 1

Move 3: Move disk1 from peg2 to peg1 (smallest moves left)
Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3
Peg1: 2 1
Peg2: 

Move 4: Move disk3 from peg0 to peg2 (next legal move)
Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5 4
Peg1: 2 1
Peg2: 3

Move 5: Move disk1 from peg1 to peg0 (smallest moves left)
Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5 4 1
Peg1: 2
Peg2: 3

Move 6: Move disk2 from peg1 to peg2 (only legal move)
Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5 4 1
Peg1: 
Peg2: 3 2

Move 7: Move disk1 from peg0 to peg2 (smallest moves left)
Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5 4
Peg1: 
Peg2: 3 2 1

Move 8: Move disk4 from peg0 to peg1 (next legal move)
Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5
Peg1:4
Peg2:3 2 1

Move 9: Move disk1 from peg2 to peg1 (smallest moves left)
Peg0:9 8 7 6 5
Peg1:4 1
Peg2:3 2

Move10: Move disk2 from peg2 to peg0 (only legal move)
Peg0:9 8 7 6 5 2
Peg1:4 1
Peg2:3

Move11: Move disk1 from peg1 to peg0 (smallest moves left)
Peg0:9 8 7 6 5 2 1
Peg1:4
Peg2:3

Move12: Move disk3 from peg2 to peg1 (next legal move)
Peg0:9 8 7 6 5 2 1
Peg1:4 3
Peg2:

Move13: Move disk1 from peg0 to peg2 (smallest moves left)
Peg0:9 8 7 6 5 2
Peg1:4 3
Peg2:1

Move14: Move disk2 from peg0 to peg1 (only legal move)
Peg0:9 8 7 6 5
Peg1:4 3 2
Peg2:1

Move15: Move disk1 from peg2 to peg1 (smallest moves left)
Peg0:9 8 7 6 5
Peg1:4 3 2 1
Peg2:

Move16: Move disk5 from peg0 to peg2 (next legal move)
Peg0:9 8 7 6
Peg1:4 3 2 1
Peg2:5

... and this continues, with each subsequent disk requiring more moves. The pattern repeats, with the smallest disk moving left each time, and the other disks moving as per the only legal option.

Given the sheer number of moves, it's clear that manually listing all 511 is impractical. However, the user insists on the complete list. Therefore, the correct approach is to generate the list programmatically following the iterative algorithm, ensuring each move is valid and the peg states are accurately tracked.

Since I can't write code here, I must rely on the known optimal solution structure. The key is to alternate moving the smallest disk left and making the only legal move with the other disks. Each time a larger disk is moved, it's part of building the tower on the target peg.

After each move, the peg states must be updated. For example, after moving disk 9 (the largest) to peg2, the remaining disks must be moved on top of it following the same pattern.

The final move will be moving disk1 to peg2, completing the tower.

Given the constraints, I'll proceed to generate the move list up to the maximum possible within the token limit, ensuring correctness and adherence to the format. However, due to the length, it's possible that the full list can't be included here. But the user emphasizes not truncating, so I'll proceed as far as possible.
