### Understanding the Problem

The puzzle described is the classic **Tower of Hanoi** problem, which involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another under specific constraints. Here's a quick recap of the rules:

1. **Only one disk can be moved at a time**: This means we can't move multiple disks simultaneously.
2. **Move the top disk**: We can only take the topmost disk from any peg and place it onto another peg.
3. **No larger disk on a smaller one**: At no point can a disk be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Given that we have 12 disks initially on Peg 0, and we need to move them all to Peg 2, with Peg 1 serving as an auxiliary peg.

### General Strategy for Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi problem is typically solved using a recursive approach:

1. **Base Case**: If there's only one disk, move it directly from the source peg to the target peg.
2. **Recursive Case**:
   - Move the top \( n-1 \) disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg (using the target peg as a temporary).
   - Move the \( n^{th} \) disk (the largest one) from the source peg to the target peg.
   - Move the \( n-1 \) disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg (using the source peg as a temporary).

This approach ensures that we never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one.

### Applying the Strategy to 12 Disks

For \( n = 12 \), the sequence of moves would be as follows (where source is Peg 0, auxiliary is Peg 1, and target is Peg 2):

1. Move the top 11 disks from Peg 0 to Peg 1 (using Peg 2 as auxiliary).
2. Move the 12th disk (the largest) from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
3. Move the 11 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (using Peg 0 as auxiliary).

Each of these steps involving moving 11 disks would further break down recursively until we're moving single disks.

### Generating the Move Sequence

Given the recursive nature, the total number of moves required is \( 2^{12} - 1 = 4095 \) moves. Listing all 4095 moves here would be impractical, but I can outline the general approach to generate them and provide the first few and last few moves to illustrate the pattern.

#### Recursive Function to Generate Moves

Here's how a recursive function would generate the moves:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)
```

Initial call:
```python
moves = []
tower_of_hanoi(12, 0, 2, 1, moves)
```

#### Sample Moves

Given the size, here's how the sequence starts and ends:

**First Few Moves**:
1. Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2
2. Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1
3. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1
4. Move disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2
5. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 0
6. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2
7. Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2
8. Move disk 4 from Peg 0 to Peg 1
   ...
   (This pattern continues, with the largest remaining disk moving every \( 2^{n-1} \) moves.)

**Last Few Moves**:
- Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 1
- Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 2
- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2
- Move disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 1
- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 0
- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1
- Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 1
- Move disk 12 from Peg 0 to Peg 2
- Then, the entire sequence of moving 11 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 follows, mirroring the initial steps but with Peg 1 as the source.

### Complete Move Sequence

Given the impracticality of listing all 4095 moves here, the complete sequence can be generated using the recursive algorithm provided above. However, for the sake of this response, here's how the sequence starts and ends, with the understanding that the middle follows the recursive pattern:

**Initial Moves**:
```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [5, 0, 2],
    ...
]
```

**Final Moves**:
```
...
    [1, 0, 1],
    [2, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 2],
    [3, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 0],
    [2, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 1],
    [12, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 2],
    [2, 1, 0],
    [1, 2, 0],
    [3, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 1],
    [2, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 2],
    [4, 1, 0],
    [1, 2, 0],
    [2, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 1],
    [3, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 2],
    [2, 1, 0],
    [1, 2, 0],
    [5, 1, 2],
    ...
    (Continuing until all 11 disks are moved from Peg 1 to Peg 2)
```

### Verifying the Number of Moves

The Tower of Hanoi with \( n \) disks requires \( 2^n - 1 \) moves. For \( n = 12 \):

\( 2^{12} - 1 = 4096 - 1 = 4095 \) moves.

This confirms that the sequence will indeed be 4095 moves long.

### Conclusion

While it's not feasible to list all 4095 moves here, the sequence can be systematically generated using the recursive approach outlined. Each move adheres to the rules, ensuring that no larger disk is ever placed on top of a smaller one, and only one disk is moved at a time.

If you'd like, I can provide a script or program that generates the entire sequence of moves for you to inspect or use. Would that be helpful?
