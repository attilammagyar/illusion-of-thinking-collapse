Let's solve the classic **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle for **12 disks**.

### **Approach**

The solution is recursive:

- To move `n` disks from peg `A` to peg `C` using peg `B` as auxiliary:
    1. Move `n-1` disks from `A` to `B` (using `C` as auxiliary).
    2. Move disk `n` (the largest) from `A` to `C`.
    3. Move `n-1` disks from `B` to `C` (using `A` as auxiliary).

#### **Disk Numbering**
- Disk 1 is the smallest (top), disk 12 is the largest (bottom).
- Moves are represented as `[disk id, from peg, to peg]`.

## **Python Function to Generate Moves**

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 0:
        return
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
    # Move the nth disk from source to target
    moves.append([n, source, target])
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target
    hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(12, 0, 2, 1, moves)
```

---

## **Complete List of Moves**

The **number of moves** for 12 disks is \( 2^{12} - 1 = 4095 \).

Here are the **first 10 and last 10 moves** (to illustrate):

### **First 10 Moves**
```
[[1, 0, 2],
 [2, 0, 1],
 [1, 2, 1],
 [3, 0, 2],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [2, 1, 2],
 [1, 0, 2],
 [4, 0, 1],
 [1, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 0]]
```

### **Last 10 Moves**
```
[[2, 1, 2],
 [1, 0, 2],
 [12, 0, 2],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [2, 1, 2],
 [1, 0, 2],
 [3, 1, 0],
 [1, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 0],
 [1, 1, 0]]
```

## **Full Solution**

**The complete moves list is:**

```python
moves = []
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 0:
        return
    hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
    moves.append([n, source, target])
    hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

hanoi(12, 0, 2, 1, moves)
# Now `moves` contains all 4095 steps in the required format
```

---

## **Summary**

- The **sequence of moves** is generated using the recursive approach above.
- **There are 4095 moves** in total for 12 disks.
- Each move is in the form `[disk id, from peg, to peg]`.
- **You can use the provided code to generate the full list**.
