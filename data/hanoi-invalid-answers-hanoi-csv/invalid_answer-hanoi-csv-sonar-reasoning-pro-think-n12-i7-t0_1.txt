Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 12 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation. First, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi solution follows a recursive approach. For n disks, the minimum number of moves is 2^n - 1. For 12 disks, that's 4095 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

The standard recursive method involves moving the top n-1 disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg, then moving the nth disk to the target peg, and finally moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg. But generating all those moves step-by-step manually isn't feasible. However, there's an iterative approach mentioned in the sources. The iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only valid move with a non-smallest disk. 

From source [2], the iterative solution says to alternate moves between the smallest piece and a non-smallest piece. The direction of moving the smallest disk depends on whether the number of disks is even or odd. Since 12 is even, the smallest disk should move in a specific pattern, maybe to the right each time. But I need to confirm the exact pattern. The source mentions that for an even number of disks, the stack ends up on peg C (which is peg 2 in this case), which matches the goal here.

The iterative algorithm steps are:
1. Move the smallest disk to the next peg in a direction (right if even, left if odd).
2. Make the only valid move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.
3. Repeat until all disks are on the target peg.

Since 12 is even, the smallest disk (1) should move right each time (0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0...). Each non-smallest move is determined by the only legal option available.

But generating all 4095 moves manually is impossible. However, the user provided an example for 3 disks. Let's see if there's a pattern or formula to generate each move step. The example for 3 disks has 7 moves. The iterative approach for 3 disks (odd) would have the smallest disk moving left, but in the example, the first move is disk 1 from 0 to 2. Wait, maybe the direction depends on the number of disks. For even n, smallest moves right; for odd, left. So for 12, each move of the smallest disk is to the next peg to the right (0->1, 1->2, 2->0).

But how to translate this into a sequence of moves? Each step alternates between moving the smallest disk and the only possible non-smallest move. The challenge is to programmatically generate each move step by step without recursion, which is what the iterative solution does.

However, since I can't write code here, I need to find a way to represent the iterative solution's moves. The problem is that manually listing 4095 moves is impractical, but the user requires it. The sources mention that the minimum number of moves for 12 disks is 4095, so the answer must have exactly that many lines.

But given the constraints, perhaps the assistant can generate the moves using the iterative algorithm's pattern. Let's outline the steps:

1. Initialize the pegs. All disks start on peg 0.
2. Determine the direction for the smallest disk. Since 12 is even, move right (0->1->2->0...).
3. For each move:
   a. If it's an odd-numbered move (1st, 3rd, etc.), move the smallest disk in the current direction.
   b. If it's even-numbered, make the only valid move possible with the non-smallest disks.

But how to track each move's disk, from, and to? The key is that the smallest disk alternates between moving in the direction and the other moves are determined by the available pegs.

Alternatively, the iterative solution can be represented as a loop where each iteration follows the pattern. However, without writing code, it's challenging to list all 4095 moves. But the user insists, so perhaps the assistant can generate the CSV by following the iterative steps algorithmically in their mind and outputting each move.

Wait, the example given for 3 disks in the query matches the standard solution. Let's see:

For 3 disks, the moves are:
1,0,2
2,0,1
1,2,1
3,0,2
1,1,0
2,1,2
1,0,2

This follows the recursive approach: move 1 and 2 to peg 1, move 3 to peg 2, then move 1 and 2 to peg 2. But the iterative approach for 3 disks (odd) would have the smallest disk moving left. Let's check the example's moves:

Move 1: disk 1 from 0 to 2 (right)
Move 2: disk 2 from 0 to 1 (non-smallest)
Move 3: disk 1 from 2 to 1 (right again? Hmm, maybe the direction alternates based on the step.)

Wait, maybe the direction for the smallest disk is determined by the number of disks. For even n, move right; for odd, left. But in the example with 3 disks (odd), the first move is to the right. That contradicts. Maybe the initial direction is different.

Alternatively, the direction might be based on the parity of the move number. But this is getting complicated. Given the time constraints, perhaps the assistant should output the iterative solution's moves by following the algorithm step by step, even if it's time-consuming.

But given that the assistant can't actually compute each move here, perhaps they can state that the solution follows the iterative method with 4095 moves and provide the CSV. However, the user requires the actual list. Since the assistant can't generate all 4095 moves manually, perhaps they can provide a pattern or a way to generate it, but the user specifically wants the complete list.

Wait, the sources mention that the minimum number of moves is 2^n -1. For 12 disks, that's 4095 moves. The example for 3 disks has 7 moves, which is 2^3 -1. So the assistant must provide all 4095 moves. However, given the token limitations, it's impossible to list them all here. But the user insists, so perhaps the assistant will proceed to generate the list as per the iterative algorithm, even if it's truncated in the output. But the user says not to truncate, so maybe the assistant has to find a way.

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can explain the pattern and provide the first few and last few moves, but the user explicitly said not to truncate. This is a dilemma. However, the assistant's task is to follow the user's instructions. Given that, perhaps the assistant will generate the full list programmatically in their mind and output it here, but realistically, that's not feasible. 

Wait, looking back at the sources, source [2] provides an iterative solution. The steps are:

- Alternate between moving the smallest disk and the only possible non-smallest disk move.

For even n, the smallest disk moves in a specific direction. Let's try to outline the first few moves for 12 disks:

Move 1: Disk 1 from 0 to 1 (since even n, direction is right)
Move 2: Only possible non-smallest move is disk 2 from 0 to 2
Move 3: Disk 1 from 1 to 2
Move 4: Disk 3 from 0 to 1
Move 5: Disk 1 from 2 to 0
Move 6: Disk 2 from 2 to 1
Move 7: Disk 1 from 0 to 1
Move 8: Disk 4 from 0 to 2
... and so on.

This pattern continues, with the smallest disk moving right each time (0->1->2->0->1...) and the non-smallest moves determined by the available pegs. Each even-numbered move involves moving the next available disk that's not the smallest, following the Tower of Hanoi rules.

However, generating all 4095 moves manually is impossible here. But the user insists, so perhaps the assistant must provide the full list. Given that, the assistant would need to output the CSV with all 4095 rows. But given the token limit, this is not feasible. However, the user's note says that truncating risks a low score, so the assistant should attempt to output the complete list even if it's cut off. 

But in reality, the assistant can't generate all 4095 moves here. Therefore, the correct approach is to provide the iterative algorithm's steps and explain that the full list follows this pattern, but the user wants the actual moves. This is a contradiction. 

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the recursive approach to generate the moves. The recursive function for Tower of Hanoi is:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"1,{source},{target}")
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        print(f"{n},{source},{target}")
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

For n=12, this would generate the moves. But again, listing all 4095 moves is impractical here. However, the assistant's task is to output them. 

Given the constraints, the assistant must proceed to generate the CSV as per the recursive solution. Let's attempt to outline the first few moves and then indicate the pattern, but the user insists on the full list. 

Wait, the user's example for 3 disks uses the recursive approach. So the correct solution for 12 disks would follow the same recursive pattern. Therefore, the assistant must generate all 4095 moves by following the recursive algorithm. 

But how? The assistant can't compute each move here. However, perhaps the assistant can write a script that generates the moves and then outputs them. But since the assistant can't execute code, they must mentally simulate the recursive steps. 

Alternatively, the assistant can acknowledge that the solution requires 4095 moves and provide them in the CSV format. However, given the token limit, it's impossible. Therefore, the assistant must proceed to output the full list, even if it's truncated by the system. 

But the user's note says not to truncate, so the assistant must output the full list. Therefore, the assistant will proceed to generate the CSV as per the recursive solution, starting with moving disk 1, then disk 2, etc., following the Tower of Hanoi algorithm. 

The final answer is the complete list of 4095 moves in the specified CSV format.
