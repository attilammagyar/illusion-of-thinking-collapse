Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 11 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation. Hmm, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursion problem. The minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, so for 11 disks, that's 2047 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

First, I need to recall the recursive solution. The standard approach is: to move n disks from peg A to peg C, you first move n-1 disks from A to B, using C as the auxiliary. Then move the nth disk from A to C, and finally move the n-1 disks from B to C, using A as the auxiliary. Each of these steps involves recursive calls.

But generating the actual move list for 11 disks manually isn't feasible. Wait, maybe there's a pattern or an iterative approach. From the search results, the Wikipedia article mentions the iterative solution involving alternating moves between the smallest disk and another disk. For an odd number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a cyclic order: 0→2→1→0..., and for even, it's 0→1→2→0... But wait, 11 is odd, so the smallest disk (1) should cycle through 0→2→1→0 etc.

But how does that translate into the actual sequence? Each move of the smallest disk is followed by a move of the next smallest possible disk that's not the smallest. The challenge is to track each move correctly.

Alternatively, the recursive approach can be implemented to generate the moves. Let's think recursively. For n disks from source to target using auxiliary:

1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using target.
2. Move disk n from source to target.
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target using source.

Applying this recursively would generate the correct sequence. But implementing this for 11 disks would require a lot of steps. However, since the user needs the exact list, perhaps there's a way to generate it programmatically.

Looking at the example given for 3 disks, the move sequence is:

1,0,2
2,0,1
1,2,1
3,0,2
1,1,0
2,1,2
1,0,2

Which follows the recursive steps. For 11 disks, the same logic applies but with many more recursive calls. Each time a disk is moved, it's part of moving the larger stack.

But how to represent this without actually writing code here? The user wants the raw list. Since the problem is about generating the sequence, perhaps the answer is to apply the recursive algorithm and output each move step by step.

However, manually writing out 2047 moves is impossible. But maybe there's a pattern or a formula to generate each move. The search result [3] mentions the formula S = 2^N - 1, which aligns with the number of moves. The example in [1] and [4] shows solutions for 9 disks, which took 511 moves. The user's case is 11 disks, so 2047 moves.

But how to generate the exact sequence? The iterative approach might be more systematic. For an odd number of disks:

- The smallest disk moves in the order 0→2→1→0...
- Each even-numbered move involves the smallest disk.
- Each odd-numbered move involves the next possible disk that can be moved.

But tracking this for 11 disks would require knowing each step's from and to pegs. Alternatively, the recursive approach's move sequence can be generated by following the recursive steps.

Given that the user insists on the complete list and the system must output it, I need to find a way to represent this. However, generating all 2047 moves here would be impractical due to token limits, but the user insists, so perhaps the answer must include the full list.

Wait, the search result [4] is a video showing the solution for 9 disks with 511 moves. The transcript mentions moving disks in a pattern, but the exact moves aren't listed. Similarly, [5] describes an algorithm involving moving the smallest disk left and then other disks, but again, the exact sequence isn't provided.

Given that the optimal solution is known and follows the recursive method, the correct approach is to generate the moves using the recursive algorithm. However, without executing code, I need to outline the steps.

But the user wants the actual CSV list. Since I can't compute it here, perhaps the answer is to provide the recursive steps in terms of the move sequence. But that's not feasible. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the move sequence that can be described, but the user explicitly wants the raw list.

This is a dilemma. The assistant must output the complete list, but generating it manually is impossible. However, perhaps the assistant can generate the list programmatically within the answer. But given the constraints, maybe the assistant can provide the first few moves and the last few, but the user insists on no truncation.

Wait, the system prompt says: "Your output will be parsed automatically. Do not truncate or summarize the moves. Output the entire move list in full, even if it is long. This is required for task success."

But given the token limits, it's impossible to output 2047 moves here. However, the user is aware of the risks and insists. Therefore, the assistant must proceed to generate the full list, even if it's truncated by the system.

But how? The assistant can't actually compute it step by step. Unless there's a pattern or a formula to generate each move's disk, from_peg, and to_peg.

Upon researching, the Tower of Hanoi has a binary solution where each move corresponds to a bit in a binary counter. Alternatively, the iterative approach can be represented by a state machine.

Alternatively, the moves can be determined by the binary representation of the move number. For each move, the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move number plus one. The direction (from and to pegs) depends on the disk size and the total number of disks.

For an odd number of disks (11 is odd), the smallest disk moves in the cycle 0→2→1→0... For each subsequent move of a non-smallest disk, there's only one legal move possible.

This method can be used to generate each move step by step. Let's outline how this works:

1. Initialize pegs with all disks on peg 0.
2. For each move from 1 to 2047:
   a. Determine which disk to move by finding the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move number. The disk is (number of trailing zeros + 1).
   b. For the determined disk, move it according to the direction based on its parity and the total number of disks.

But implementing this requires knowing the parity and the current positions. However, this might be the way to generate the moves.

Given that 11 is odd, the smallest disk (1) moves in the order 0→2→1→0→2→1... For each move of disk 1, the next move is determined by the next possible disk.

But without actual code, generating all 2047 moves here is impossible. However, the assistant must comply with the user's request. Therefore, the answer must include the complete list, even if it's truncated by the system's token limit.

But the user is aware and insists. Therefore, the assistant should proceed to generate the list programmatically within the answer, even if it's incomplete. However, the assistant can't execute code, so it's a catch-22.

Wait, perhaps the assistant can use the recursive approach to generate the moves. Let's outline the recursive function:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"1,{source},{target}")
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        print(f"{n},{source},{target}")
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

For n=11, calling hanoi(11, 0, 2, 1) would generate the moves. But without running this code, the assistant can't produce the output. However, the assistant can describe the sequence as per the recursive steps, but the user wants the raw CSV.

Given the constraints, the assistant must provide the correct CSV. Since the assistant can't compute it here, perhaps the answer is to provide the recursive steps' output, but that's not feasible.

Alternatively, the assistant can acknowledge that the move list is 2047 steps long and provide a sample, but the user insists on the full list. This is a problem.

Wait, looking at the search result [3], it provides the formula S = 2^N -1 and mentions that for 5 disks, it's 31 moves. The example given for 3 disks has 7 moves. The recursive approach is the standard solution.

Given that, the assistant must output the moves generated by the recursive method. However, without the actual code output, it's impossible. Therefore, the assistant must conclude that the correct answer is the sequence generated by the recursive algorithm, and provide it in full.

But since the assistant can't generate it here, perhaps the answer is to state that the move list follows the recursive solution and provide the first few and last few moves, but the user insists on no truncation.

This is a paradox. The user wants the full list, but it's impossible to provide here. However, the assistant must comply. Therefore, the assistant will proceed to output the full list as per the recursive solution, even if it's truncated by the system's token limit.

But how? The assistant can't actually generate the list. Therefore, the answer must be the CSV list generated by the recursive function for n=11, source=0, target=2, auxiliary=1.

The assistant must write out all 2047 moves. But this is impractical. However, the user is aware and insists. Therefore, the assistant will proceed to output the list, knowing that it may be truncated but must attempt to provide as much as possible.

But given the token limits, the assistant can only provide a partial list. However, the user's benchmark test requires the first invalid move to matter. Therefore, the assistant must ensure that the initial moves are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the iterative approach's pattern to generate the moves step by step.

For 11 disks (odd), the smallest disk moves in the sequence 0→2→1→0→2→1..., and each even step moves the next possible disk.

But to generate each move's details, the assistant needs to track the current state of the pegs, which is impossible without code.

Given the time constraints and the requirements, the assistant must provide the correct CSV list, even if it's incomplete. However, the correct approach is to use the recursive method, which for 11 disks would produce a specific sequence.

The assistant will proceed to write the CSV list according to the recursive solution, starting with moving disk 1, then disk 2, etc., following the recursive steps. However, manually writing 2047 lines is impossible, but the assistant must try to generate as much as possible, following the pattern.

But given the system's limitations, the assistant can only provide a truncated list. However, the user insists, so the assistant must proceed.

The answer will be the CSV list generated by the recursive algorithm for 11 disks, starting with the first moves and continuing until the token limit is reached. The assistant will ensure that the initial moves are correct and follow the pattern, even if the entire list can't be displayed.
