Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 8 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's 8 disks, the minimum number of moves required is 2^8 - 1, which is 255 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list without truncation.

First, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi has a recursive solution. For n disks, you move the top n-1 disks to the auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the target peg, and then move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg. But writing out all 255 moves manually would be time-consuming and error-prone. However, there's a pattern based on binary representations or iterative methods that can generate the moves systematically.

Looking at the search results, result [3] from Wikipedia mentions a binary solution. It provides formulas to determine the from and to pegs for each move based on the move number. For the mth move, the from peg is (m & m - 1) % 3, and the to peg is ((m | m - 1) + 1) % 3. But there's a note that for even n, the references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed. Since we have 8 disks (even n), we'll need to adjust the peg calculations accordingly.

Another approach mentioned in the results is the iterative method. For each move, the smallest disk (disk 1) moves in a cyclic pattern: for even n, it moves between pegs 0, 2, 1, 0, etc., and for odd n, it's a different cycle. But since n=8 is even, disk 1 will alternate between pegs 0, 2, 1, 0, and so on. The other moves involve moving the next available disk that's not the smallest, ensuring it's placed on a larger disk.

But implementing this requires tracking the state of each peg after each move. Given the complexity, perhaps using the binary method with the adjusted formulas for even n would be more straightforward. Let's verify the formulas:

For even n (8 is even), the from and to pegs are calculated as:
from_peg = (m - (m & -m)) % 3
to_peg = (m + (m & -m)) % 3

But wait, the Wikipedia article mentions that for even n, the references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed. So maybe after calculating the to_peg, we swap pegs 1 and 2? Or perhaps the formulas themselves adjust for even n. Let me check the exact wording from [3]:

"For even n puzzles, the output references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed."

Hmm, that suggests that after computing the from and to pegs using the standard formulas, if n is even, we swap pegs 1 and 2 in the result. But how exactly? Let's see the example given in [3] for move 216, which is part of an even n puzzle. The from peg is 2 and to peg is 1 after adjustment. So perhaps for even n, whenever the formula gives a peg 1, we use 2 instead, and vice versa. Alternatively, the formulas might already account for this when n is even.

Alternatively, the binary solution's from and to pegs are determined by the move number, and for even n, the parity affects the direction. Let's test with a small example. For n=3 (odd), the standard solution applies. For n=2 (even), the moves would be different. Let's see:

For n=2, the moves should be:
1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 1
2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 2
3. Move disk 1 from 1 to 2

Using the formula for m=1:
from_peg = (1 & 0) % 3 = 0
to_peg = ((1 | 0) +1) %3 = (1+1)%3=2
But since n=2 is even, we need to reverse pegs 1 and 2. Wait, the initial move for n=2 is from 0 to 1, but according to the formula, to_peg would be 2. That doesn't match. So perhaps the adjustment is different.

Alternatively, the formulas provided in [3] are for odd n, and for even n, we need to swap the to_peg and from_peg in some way. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe a better approach is to use the recursive method to generate the moves, but since it's 8 disks, that's 255 moves, which would require a lot of steps.

Alternatively, the iterative approach can be used. For each move, determine which disk to move based on the move number. The disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move number. For example, move 1 (binary 1) has 0 trailing zeros, so disk 1 is moved. Move 2 (10) has 1 trailing zero, so disk 2. Move 3 (11) has 0 trailing zeros, disk 1 again, etc.

Once the disk is determined, the direction it moves depends on whether the disk is odd or even. For even-numbered disks, the direction is different. Wait, but the user's problem has 8 disks, numbered 1 (smallest) to 8 (largest). So disk 1 is the smallest, disk 8 the largest.

In the iterative approach, the smallest disk (disk 1) moves in a cycle. For an even number of disks, the cycle is 0 → 2 → 1 → 0 → ..., and for odd, it's 0 → 1 → 2 → 0 → ... Since we have 8 disks (even), disk 1 moves 0→2→1→0...

For the other disks, you move the smallest possible disk that's not disk 1, and there's only one valid move for that disk each time.

But implementing this requires keeping track of the state of each peg after each move. Let's try to outline the steps:

1. Initialize pegs: peg0 = [8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], peg1 = [], peg2 = [].
2. For each move from 1 to 255:
   a. Determine which disk to move based on the number of trailing zeros in the move number (binary). The disk number is (number of trailing zeros) + 1.
   b. For disk 1, move it in the cycle 0→2→1→0...
   c. For other disks, determine the possible move (only one valid move exists where it can be placed on a larger disk or empty peg).

But tracking the state for 255 moves manually is impractical. Instead, perhaps using the binary method with the adjusted formulas for even n is better.

From [3], the formulas for from and to pegs when n is even require swapping pegs 1 and 2. So, after calculating the from and to pegs using the standard formulas, if n is even, swap 1 and 2 in the result.

Wait, the Wikipedia example says for even n, the references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed. So, for example, if the formula gives to_peg=1, we use 2 instead, and vice versa.

Let me test this with n=2. The correct moves are:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 1
2. Move 2 from 0 to 2
3. Move 1 from 1 to 2

Using the formula for m=1 (first move):
from_peg = (m & m-1) %3 = (1 & 0) %3 = 0
to_peg = ((m | m-1)+1) %3 = ((1 | 0)+1)%3 = (1+1)%3=2
But since n=2 is even, we swap pegs 1 and 2. So to_peg becomes 1 instead of 2. So the first move is from 0 to 1, which matches the correct move.

For m=2:
from_peg = (2 & 1) %3 = 0
to_peg = ((2 |1)+1)%3 = (3+1)%3=1 → after swap, to_peg=2. So move disk 2 from 0 to 2, which is correct.

For m=3:
from_peg = (3 & 2) %3 = 2%3=2
to_peg = ((3 |2)+1)%3 = (3+1)%3=1 → after swap, to_peg=2. So move from peg 2 to peg 2? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, m=3 in binary is 11. The number of trailing zeros is 0, so disk 1 is moved. According to the cycle for even n, disk 1 should move from 1 to 2. But according to the formula, after swap, the to_peg would be 2. Let's recalculate:

For m=3, using the formula:
from_peg = (3 & 2) %3 = 2%3=2
to_peg = ((3 |2)+1)%3 = (3+1)%3=1 → swap to 2.

But disk 1 is on peg1 after move 2. So moving from peg1 to peg2. That's correct. So the third move is from 1 to 2, which matches.

So the formula works when we swap pegs 1 and 2 for even n.

Therefore, the approach is:

For each move m from 1 to 255:
1. Calculate the from_peg and to_peg using the formulas:
   from_peg = (m & m - 1) % 3
   to_peg = ((m | m - 1) + 1) % 3
2. Since n=8 is even, swap pegs 1 and 2 in the from_peg and to_peg.
   - If from_peg is 1, set it to 2; if it's 2, set to 1.
   - Similarly for to_peg.
3. Determine which disk is being moved by counting the number of trailing zeros in m's binary representation, then add 1. For example, m=1 (0b1) has 0 trailing zeros → disk 1. m=2 (0b10) has 1 trailing zero → disk 2. m=3 (0b11) has 0 → disk 1, etc.
4. Update the pegs' states accordingly, ensuring that a larger disk is never placed on a smaller one.

But wait, the formulas from Wikipedia might already account for the even n adjustment. Let me check the exact text from [3]:

"For even n puzzles, the output references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed."

So after calculating from_peg and to_peg using the formulas, we need to swap references to pegs 1 and 2. That means, for example, if the formula gives from_peg=1, we use 2 instead, and if it gives from_peg=2, we use 1. Similarly for to_peg.

So the steps would be:

For each move m from 1 to 255:
1. Calculate from_peg and to_peg using the standard formulas.
2. If n is even, swap 1 and 2 in both from_peg and to_peg.
3. Determine the disk to move (trailing zeros +1).
4. Perform the move, updating the peg states.

But how do we track the peg states? Since the user wants the complete list of moves with peg states after each move, we need to simulate each move step-by-step.

Starting with peg0 = [8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], peg1 = [], peg2 = [].

For each move m from 1 to 255:
1. Calculate from_peg and to_peg using the formulas, then swap 1 and 2 if n is even.
2. Find the disk to move (trailing zeros in m's binary +1).
3. Check if the top disk on from_peg is the disk to move.
4. Move it to to_peg, ensuring it's placed on a larger disk or empty peg.
5. Record the move and update the peg states.

But simulating this for 255 moves is tedious. However, since the user insists on the complete list, I need to generate it programmatically. Since I can't write code here, I'll have to rely on the pattern.

Alternatively, using the recursive approach, the sequence of moves can be generated. For 8 disks, the recursive steps would involve moving 7 disks to peg1, then moving disk8 to peg2, then moving 7 disks from peg1 to peg2. Each of these steps would involve further recursion.

But again, enumerating all 255 moves manually is impractical. However, the binary method provides a systematic way to generate each move's from and to pegs, and the disk to move.

Let's try to generate the first few moves and see if the pattern holds.

Move 1:
m=1, binary 1, trailing zeros=0 → disk 1.
Formulas:
from_peg = (1 & 0) %3 = 0
to_peg = ((1 |0)+1)%3 = 2%3=2
Since n=8 is even, swap 1 and 2 in from/to pegs. But from_peg is 0, to_peg is 2. Swapping 1 and 2 doesn't affect them. So move disk1 from 0 to 2.

After move1:
peg0: [8,7,6,5,4,3,2], peg1: [], peg2: [1]

Move2:
m=2, binary 10, trailing zeros=1 → disk2.
from_peg = (2 &1) %3 = 0
to_peg = ((2|1)+1)%3 = (3+1)%3=1
Swap 1 and 2: to_peg becomes 2. So move disk2 from 0 to 2. But peg2 has disk1, which is smaller than disk2. So this is invalid. Wait, this can't be right. There's a mistake here.

Wait, according to the rules, you can't place a larger disk on a smaller one. So moving disk2 to peg2 which has disk1 is invalid. This suggests that the formula might not directly give the correct to_peg when considering the current state. Therefore, the formulas alone might not account for the current state of the pegs, and thus the moves generated might not be valid unless we track the state.

This indicates that the binary method's formulas give the from and to pegs based on the move number, but the actual validity depends on the current state. Therefore, to generate the correct sequence, we need to simulate each move, ensuring that the move is valid.

This complicates things because without tracking the state, we can't be sure that the formulas alone will produce valid moves. Therefore, the correct approach must involve simulating each move step-by-step, keeping track of the disks on each peg.

Given the complexity, perhaps the best way is to use the recursive approach to generate the moves. The recursive algorithm for Tower of Hanoi is:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}")
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}")
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

For n=8, the sequence would involve moving the top 7 disks from peg0 to peg1, then moving disk8 from peg0 to peg2, then moving the 7 disks from peg1 to peg2.

But translating this into the actual move list requires keeping track of all intermediate moves. Each recursive call generates a sequence of moves. For example, moving 7 disks requires 127 moves, then 1 move for disk8, then another 127 moves, totaling 255.

However, the challenge is to list all 255 moves with their respective from and to pegs, along with the peg states after each move. This is quite involved, but perhaps there's a pattern in the moves that can be captured.

Alternatively, the iterative approach can be used, which alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only other valid move. For even n, the smallest disk moves in the cycle 0→2→1→0..., and for each non-smallest disk move, there's only one valid option.

Let's outline the iterative approach steps for n=8:

1. The smallest disk (1) moves in the cycle 0→2→1→0→2→1... etc.
2. After each move of the smallest disk, make the only other possible move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

This alternation continues until all disks are moved.

For each move:
- If the move number is odd, move the smallest disk.
- If even, move the next available disk.

But tracking this requires knowing the state after each move. Let's attempt the first few moves:

Move 1 (odd): Move disk1 from 0→2.
Peg0: [8,7,6,5,4,3,2], Peg2: [1]

Move 2 (even): Move the next possible disk (disk2) from 0→1 (since it can't go to peg2 which has disk1).
Peg0: [8,7,6,5,4,3], Peg1: [2], Peg2: [1]

Move3 (odd): Move disk1 from 2→1.
Peg1: [2,1], Peg2: []

Move4 (even): Move disk3 from 0→2.
Peg0: [8,7,6,5,4], Peg2: [3]

Move5 (odd): Move disk1 from 1→0.
Peg0: [8,7,6,5,4,1], Peg1: [2]

Move6 (even): Move disk2 from 1→2.
Peg1: [], Peg2: [3,2]

Move7 (odd): Move disk1 from 0→2.
Peg0: [8,7,6,5,4], Peg2: [3,2,1]

Move8 (even): Move disk4 from 0→1.
Peg0: [8,7,6,5], Peg1: [4]

... and so on.

Continuing this pattern would generate all 255 moves. However, manually listing each move and updating the peg states is impractical. Therefore, the solution must rely on a systematic method to generate each move correctly.

Given the user's insistence on the complete list and the format required, the answer must be generated using a method that ensures all moves are correct and the peg states are accurately tracked after each move.

Since I can't write a program here, I'll have to rely on the known optimal solution for 8 disks, which requires 255 moves. The exact sequence can be generated using the recursive method, but enumerating all 255 moves here would be extensive. However, the user demands the full list, so I must provide it.

But given the token limitations, it's possible that the full list would exceed the allowed output. However, the user explicitly states that truncating the list risks a low score, so I must attempt to provide the complete list.

The solution involves generating each move step-by-step, following the iterative approach, ensuring that each move is valid and the peg states are updated correctly. Each move of the smallest disk alternates between pegs 0→2→1→0..., and the other moves are determined by the only valid move available.

Here's the start of the move list:

1. Move disk1 from 0 to 2
2. Move disk2 from 0 to 1
3. Move disk1 from 2 to 1
4. Move disk3 from 0 to 2
5. Move disk1 from 1 to 0
6. Move disk2 from 1 to 2
7. Move disk1 from 0 to 2
8. Move disk4 from 0 to 1
9. Move disk1 from 2 to 1
10. Move disk2 from 2 to 0
11. Move disk1 from 1 to 0
12. Move disk3 from 2 to 1
13. Move disk1 from 0 to 2
14. Move disk2 from 0 to 1
15. Move disk1 from 2 to 1
16. Move disk5 from 0 to 2
...

This pattern continues, with each layer adding more moves. However, listing all 255 moves manually is error-prone. Instead, using the binary method with the adjusted formulas for even n seems more feasible.

Using the formulas from [3], adjusted for even n:

For each move m from 1 to 255:
1. Calculate from_peg = (m & m - 1) % 3
2. Calculate to_peg = ((m | m - 1) + 1) % 3
3. Swap pegs 1 and 2 in from_peg and to_peg because n is even.
4. Determine the disk to move by counting trailing zeros in m's binary +1.
5. Update the peg states accordingly.

Let's test this for the first few moves:

Move 1 (m=1):
binary 1 → trailing zeros=0 → disk1
from_peg = (1 & 0) %3 = 0
to_peg = ((1 |0)+1)%3 = 2
Swap 1 and 2: from_peg remains 0, to_peg remains 2 (since they are 0 and 2, not 1 or 2). So move disk1 from 0→2.

Move 2 (m=2):
binary 10 → trailing zeros=1 → disk2
from_peg = (2 &1) %3 = 0
to_peg = ((2|1)+1)%3 = 3+1=4%3=1
Swap 1 and 2: to_peg becomes 2. So move disk2 from 0→2. But peg2 has disk1, which is smaller. Invalid move. This indicates a problem with the formula approach when not considering the current state.

This suggests that the formulas alone don't account for the current state of the pegs, leading to invalid moves. Therefore, the formulas must be used in conjunction with state tracking to ensure validity.

Given this, the correct approach must involve simulating each move while tracking the state, which is beyond manual computation. However, since the user requires the complete list, I must generate it accurately.

After careful consideration, the optimal solution for 8 disks involves 255 moves, following the recursive pattern. Each move can be determined by the iterative method, alternating between moving the smallest disk and the next valid move. The exact sequence is known, and the peg states can be derived step-by-step.

Therefore, the final answer is the complete list of 255 moves, each correctly transferring a disk and updating the peg states accordingly. The moves follow the Tower of Hanoi's optimal solution, ensuring no larger disk is placed on a smaller one.
