Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 8 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves in CSV format without any explanation. First, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursion problem. For n disks, the minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1. So for 8 disks, that's 255 moves. The challenge is to generate all these moves correctly.

The recursive approach involves moving the top n-1 disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg, then moving the nth disk to the target peg, and finally moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg. But since the user wants the explicit list, I need to figure out the pattern of moves.

Looking at the example provided for 3 disks, the solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For even and odd numbers of disks, the direction of moving the smallest disk changes. Since 8 is even, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move in a specific pattern, perhaps between pegs 0, 2, and 1 in a cycle.

From the search results, especially result [5], there's mention of an algorithm involving moving disk 1 to the left repeatedly and alternating with moving other disks. For even-numbered disks, the initial move is to the right. Wait, the example in [5] for seven disks (odd) starts moving disk 1 to the left, but for even, maybe it's to the right. But the user's initial configuration is peg 0, and target is peg 2. So the standard solution would involve moving the disks from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1 as auxiliary.

The recursive solution would generate the moves, but implementing that here without code might be tricky. Alternatively, there's an iterative approach: for each move, alternate between moving the smallest disk and making the only other valid move. The smallest disk moves in a consistent direction (right for even, left for odd). Since 8 is even, the smallest disk moves right each time (0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0...). But I need to confirm this.

Wait, in the example for 3 disks (odd), the moves start with disk 1 to peg 2. For even, maybe the first move is to peg 1. Let me check the example given in the query. The 3-disk example starts with moving disk 1 from peg 0 to 2. That's for odd. So for even (8 disks), the first move should be disk 1 to peg 1. Then the next move is the only other possible move not involving disk 1. Then move disk 1 again, and so on.

But how to generate all 255 moves step by step? It's a bit tedious, but there's a pattern. Each even-numbered move (2nd, 4th, etc.) involves moving a non-1 disk. The positions of the disks can be tracked, but since the user just wants the list, perhaps there's a known sequence.

Alternatively, using the recursive method, the moves can be generated. Let's think recursively. To move 8 disks from peg 0 to peg 2:

1. Move 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary.
2. Move disk 8 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move 7 disks from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary.

Each of these steps is recursive. For each step, the same logic applies. Breaking this down, each recursive call will generate the moves for n-1 disks. But enumerating all 255 moves manually is error-prone. However, there's a pattern in the moves when you look at the binary representation or the parity of the move number.

Another approach is to note that the sequence of moves follows a specific pattern where the smallest disk moves every other move. For each move, if it's an odd-numbered move, move the smallest disk in the predetermined direction (for even n, right; for odd n, left). For even n=8, the direction is right, so peg 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0, etc. The even-numbered moves involve moving the next available disk that's not the smallest, which can only be one possible move.

But how to translate this into the actual sequence? Let's try to outline the first few moves for 8 disks:

Move 1: Disk 1 from 0 to 1 (smallest disk moves right)
Move 2: Disk 2 from 0 to 2 (only other possible move)
Move 3: Disk 1 from 1 to 2 (smallest disk moves right)
Move 4: Disk 3 from 0 to 1 (next available disk)
Move 5: Disk 1 from 2 to 0 (smallest disk moves right, wrapping around)
Move 6: Disk 2 from 2 to 1
Move 7: Disk 1 from 0 to 1
Move 8: Disk 4 from 0 to 2
...

This pattern continues, with the smallest disk moving every other step, and the other moves involving the next smallest disk that can be moved. However, manually listing all 255 steps is impractical. But since the user insists on the complete list, I need to generate it accurately.

Alternatively, using the recursive approach, the moves can be generated by simulating the recursion. Let's define a function that, given n, source, target, and auxiliary, generates the moves. For n=8, source=0, target=2, auxiliary=1.

The standard recursive algorithm is:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"1,{source},{target}")
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        print(f"{n},{source},{target}")
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

Applying this for n=8, the moves would be generated in the order of moving 7 disks from 0->1, then disk 8 from 0->2, then 7 disks from 1->2. Each of those 7-disk moves would themselves follow the same pattern.

But how to translate this into the actual CSV list? Let's see for n=3 as in the example:

The recursive calls would be:

hanoi(3,0,2,1)
-> hanoi(2,0,1,2)
   -> hanoi(1,0,2,1) → move 1: 0→2
   → move 2: 2→1
   -> hanoi(1,2,1,0) → move 3: 2→1
→ move 4: 0→2
-> hanoi(2,1,2,0)
   -> hanoi(1,1,0,2) → move 5:1→0
   → move 6:1→2
   -> hanoi(1,0,2,1) → move 7:0→2

Which matches the example given. So the recursive approach generates the correct sequence. Therefore, for n=8, following this recursive method will produce the correct 255 moves.

Now, the task is to list all 255 moves according to this recursive pattern. However, doing this manually is impossible, but perhaps there's a known sequence or a way to generate it step by step.

Alternatively, since the user provided search results, maybe one of them has the solution. Looking at the search results:

Result [1] mentions a video showing the solution for 8 disks with 255 moves. Result [3] also refers to solving it with 8 disks. However, the actual move list isn't provided in the search results. The example given in the query for 3 disks is from the user, not the search results.

Therefore, the assistant must generate the move list programmatically, but since it can't execute code, it has to rely on the recursive pattern and output the moves accordingly.

Given that, the correct approach is to follow the recursive algorithm and list all the moves. Each move of a larger disk is preceded and followed by the necessary moves of smaller disks. For 8 disks, this would involve a lot of repetition, but the pattern is consistent.

However, generating all 255 moves here would be extremely lengthy, but the user insists on the complete list. Therefore, the assistant must output all 255 moves in the correct order, following the recursive approach.

The final CSV will start with moving disk 1 between pegs, followed by disk 2, and so on, following the recursive steps. Each time a larger disk is moved, it's placed on the target peg, and the smaller disks are moved around it.

Given the constraints, the assistant must generate the entire list correctly. Since the recursive method is well-established, the moves can be generated step by step, ensuring that each move adheres to the rules.
