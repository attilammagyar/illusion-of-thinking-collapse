Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 10 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to move all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's a classic recursive problem, I remember the standard approach is to use recursion: move n-1 disks to the auxiliary peg, move the nth disk to the target, then move the n-1 disks onto the target.

For 10 disks, the minimum number of moves is 2^10 - 1, which is 1023 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list. Let me recall the recursive algorithm. Each move can be generated by following the recursive steps. The challenge is to translate the recursive steps into the specific move list format required: each move is [disk, from, to], with pegs 0-indexed.

Wait, in the example given, the moves for 3 disks start with moving disk 1 from 0 to 2. So the disk numbers are based on their size, with 1 being the smallest. The algorithm needs to track which disk is being moved each time. But in the recursive approach, the disk numbers aren't explicitly tracked; instead, the steps are based on the problem decomposition. Hmm, how do I map each recursive call to the actual disk numbers?

Wait, the disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to 10 (largest). The initial setup is peg 0 has disks 10 (bottom) up to 1 (top). So when moving, the top disk is always the smallest available. But in the recursive solution, each time we move a disk, it's the top disk of the source peg. But to get the disk ID, we need to know which disk is being moved at each step. However, the standard Tower of Hanoi problem doesn't track individual disk numbers but rather the order of moves. But the user's example shows that each move includes the disk's ID. So how do we determine which disk is moved at each step?

Wait, perhaps the disk numbers correspond to their size. The smallest disk is 1, next 2, up to 10. Each time a disk is moved, it's the smallest one available. But in the recursive solution, the order of moves alternates between moving the smallest and the next available. For example, with 3 disks, the moves are:

1 from 0 to 2

2 from 0 to 1

1 from 2 to 1

3 from 0 to 2

1 from 1 to 0

2 from 1 to 2

1 from 0 to 2

So the disk numbers are in the order of their size, and each move of a larger disk is preceded and followed by moves of smaller disks. Therefore, the recursive approach can generate the sequence of disk numbers by considering the order in which they are moved. But how to generate the exact list for 10 disks?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can generate the sequence of moves without simulating each step. For example, the sequence of moves for each disk follows a certain pattern based on the number of disks. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a cyclic pattern (0->1->2->0 for even n), and for odd n, it's 0->2->1->0. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, each disk's moves can be determined by its position. For disk k (1 being smallest), the number of moves it makes is 2^(k-1), and the direction depends on whether k is odd or even. For example, disk 1 moves every other move, alternating between pegs. For even n, the smallest disk moves in a cycle of 0->2->1->0, while for odd n, it's 0->1->2->0. Wait, maybe that's the case. Let me think.

But with 10 disks, which is even, the smallest disk (1) would move in the pattern 0->1->2->0->1->2 etc. But how does that translate into the actual sequence? This might be a way to generate the moves without recursion, but I need to map each move to the correct disk and peg transitions.

Alternatively, since the problem requires the exact list, perhaps the best approach is to simulate the recursive algorithm and track each move, recording the disk number, source, and target pegs. But how to do that programmatically without actually writing code here?

Wait, the recursive function for Tower of Hanoi is:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}")
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}")
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

Each call to hanoi(n, ...) moves n disks. So for n=10, the first recursive call moves 9 disks from source (0) to auxiliary (1), using target (2) as the auxiliary. Then moves disk 10 from 0 to 2. Then moves the 9 disks from 1 to 2, using 0 as auxiliary.

But each time a disk is moved, it's the nth disk in that call. So the order of disk moves is determined by the recursion. For example, the first move of the 10-disk problem is moving disk 1 from 0 to 1 (but wait, no, because the first recursive call is hanoi(9, 0, 1, 2). So in that call, the first move would be hanoi(8, 0, 2, 1), and so on until n=1, which moves disk 1 from 0 to 1. Then disk 2 is moved from 0 to 2, etc.

Wait, but in the example given for 3 disks, the first move is disk 1 from 0 to 2. Let's see:

For n=3, the steps are:

hanoi(2, 0, 1, 2) → which involves:

hanoi(1, 0, 2, 1) → move disk 1 from 0 to 2

move disk 2 from 0 to 1

hanoi(1, 2, 1, 0) → move disk 1 from 2 to 1

Then move disk 3 from 0 to 2

Then hanoi(2, 1, 2, 0):

hanoi(1, 1, 0, 2) → move disk 1 from 1 to 0

move disk 2 from 1 to 2

hanoi(1, 0, 2, 1) → move disk 1 from 0 to 2

So the sequence is:

1: 0→2

2: 0→1

1: 2→1

3: 0→2

1: 1→0

2: 1→2

1: 0→2

Which matches the example. So each time a disk is moved, it's the current n in the recursive call. So for n=10, the first move would be part of moving 9 disks from 0 to 1, which involves moving disk 1 from 0 to 1, then disk 2 from 0 to 2, etc. Wait, no. Let's think again.

Wait, the first call for n=10 is hanoi(9, 0, 1, 2). So in that call, the first step is hanoi(8, 0, 2, 1), then move disk 9 from 0 to 1, then hanoi(8, 2, 1, 0). But each of those hanoi(8,...) calls would involve moving disks 1-8. So the first actual move is disk 1 from 0 to 2 (as part of hanoi(8,0,2,1) which itself calls hanoi(7,0,1,2), etc., until n=1, which moves disk 1).

But this seems complicated to track manually. However, the key is that each move of a disk with number k occurs exactly once in the process, and the order is determined by the recursive decomposition. The total number of moves is 2^10 -1 = 1023, which is correct.

But the problem is to generate the list of moves in the required format: each move is [disk_id, from_peg, to_peg]. So for each move, we need to know which disk is being moved (its size, 1-10), and the source and target pegs.

Given that the standard recursive approach generates the sequence of moves, but the disk numbers are determined by the level of recursion. For example, in the outermost call, we move disk 10 once. In the recursive calls before and after, we move disks 1-9.

So the sequence of disk numbers would be: the moves for n=10 involve moving disks 1-9 twice (once to auxiliary, once from auxiliary to target), and disk 10 once. Each of those moves for disks 1-9 would themselves involve moving smaller disks.

This suggests that the order of disk moves follows a pattern where smaller disks are moved more frequently, and each disk's moves are interleaved with those of larger disks.

But how to generate the exact sequence programmatically? Since I can't write code here, I need to find a pattern or a way to represent the moves based on the recursive steps.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical way to determine each move's disk, source, and target based on the move number. For example, each move can be determined by its binary representation or some other property.

Another approach: the Tower of Hanoi problem has a known iterative solution where each move is determined by the following rules:

- For even number of disks:
  - Make the legal move between pegs A and B (in either direction).
  - Make the legal move between pegs A and C (in either direction).
  - Make the legal move between pegs B and C (in either direction).
  - Repeat until complete.

- For odd number of disks:
  - Make the legal move between pegs A and C (in either direction).
  - Make the legal move between pegs A and B (in either direction).
  - Make the legal move between pegs B and C (in either direction).
  - Repeat until complete.

But I'm not sure how this helps in determining the exact sequence for 10 disks, which is even. Also, this approach might not directly give the disk numbers.

Alternatively, each disk's moves follow a specific pattern. For example, the smallest disk moves every other move, alternating between pegs in a cyclic manner. The next disk moves every fourth move, and so on. This is based on the observation that each disk moves 2^(k) times, where k is the disk number minus one. Wait, for disk 1 (smallest), it moves every 2^0 = 1 move, i.e., every move. But that's not correct. Wait, for 3 disks, disk 1 moves 4 times, which is 2^(3-1) = 4. Wait, maybe each disk k moves 2^(n - k) times. For n=3, disk 1 moves 4 times (2^(3-1) =4), disk 2 moves 2 times (2^(3-2)=2), disk 3 moves once (2^(3-3)=1). That adds up to 7 moves, which is correct.

So for n=10, disk 1 would move 2^9 times, disk 2 moves 2^8 times, ..., disk 10 moves once.

But how to determine the direction of each move for each disk. For disk k, the direction depends on whether k is odd or even. For example, if k is odd, the smallest disk moves in a cycle of 0→1→2→0, and if even, 0→2→1→0. Wait, maybe for even n, the direction is different. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the direction for each disk can be determined by the parity of the number of moves made so far for that disk. But this is getting complicated.

Given the time constraints and the need to generate the exact list, perhaps the best approach is to simulate the recursive algorithm and track each move's disk, source, and target. However, doing this manually for 1023 moves is impossible. Therefore, I need to find a pattern or a way to represent the moves algorithmically.

Wait, the recursive approach can be represented as a sequence of moves. Each time a disk is moved, it's the largest disk in the current recursive call. For example, in the outermost call, moving disk 10 from 0 to 2. But before that, all smaller disks (1-9) must be moved to peg 1, and after that, they must be moved from peg 1 to peg 2.

So the sequence of moves is:

1. Move disks 1-9 from 0 to 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary).
2. Move disk 10 from 0 to 2.
3. Move disks 1-9 from 1 to 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).

Each of these steps involves recursive moves. For step 1, moving disks 1-9 from 0 to 1 requires:

1a. Move disks 1-8 from 0 to 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary).
1b. Move disk 9 from 0 to 1.
1c. Move disks 1-8 from 2 to 1 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).

And so on, recursively.

Each time a disk is moved, it's the current n in the recursive call. So the order of disk moves is determined by the recursion depth. The challenge is to track each move's disk number, source, and target.

But without writing code, how can I generate this list? It's impractical to do manually for 10 disks. However, perhaps there's a pattern in the move sequence that can be described.

Alternatively, I can note that the standard recursive solution produces a specific sequence, and the moves can be generated by following that recursion. Each move of a larger disk is preceded by moving all smaller disks off, then moving the larger disk, then moving the smaller disks back on top.

Given that the user provided an example for 3 disks, perhaps the same pattern applies for 10 disks, just scaled up. The example's move list for 3 disks is:

[
 [1,0,2],
 [2,0,1],
 [1,2,1],
 [3,0,2],
 [1,1,0],
 [2,1,2],
 [1,0,2]
]

Notice that the moves for disk 1 are alternating between pegs, while the larger disks move once each. For 10 disks, the sequence would involve moving disk 1 many times, with the larger disks moving in between.

But generating the exact list requires knowing the order of all 1023 moves. Since I can't compute this manually, I need to find a way to represent the recursive steps in terms of the move list.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution can be represented as a recursive function that appends each move to a list. For example, the function hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves) would append the moves for n disks. For each call, when n=1, append [1, source, target]. For n>1, first call hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves), then append [n, source, target], then call hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves).

Applying this to n=10, source=0, target=2, auxiliary=1, the moves list would be generated correctly. However, without actually running the code, I need to simulate this process.

But simulating this for 10 disks would take too long. However, perhaps I can describe the process and then provide the complete list. But the user insists on the raw list without any explanation. So the answer must be the list of moves in the specified format.

Given that, and knowing that the correct sequence is generated by the recursive algorithm, the answer is the list of 1023 moves, each corresponding to the recursive steps. However, providing all 1023 moves here is impractical, but the user insists on the complete list.

Wait, but the user says: "Do not truncate or summarize the output. Output the entire move list in full, even if it is long. This is required for task success."

So I must generate the entire list. But how? Without writing a program, it's impossible to list all 1023 moves manually. However, perhaps there's a pattern or a way to generate the list using a formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution can be represented as a binary-reflected Gray code sequence, where each move corresponds to a single bit change. Each disk's moves correspond to the positions where a particular bit changes. But I'm not sure how to map this to the actual disk numbers and peg movements.

Another approach: Each move can be determined by the following rules:

- The smallest disk (1) moves in a cycle. For even n, the cycle is 0→1→2→0; for odd n, it's 0→2→1→0. Since n=10 is even, disk 1 moves 0→1→2→0→1→2... etc.

- The next disk (2) moves every two moves, but only when the smallest disk is not moving. The direction depends on the parity of the number of times it has moved.

But this is getting complicated. However, perhaps there's a way to generate the sequence iteratively.

Alternatively, the sequence of moves can be generated using the following iterative algorithm:

Initialize three pegs (source, auxiliary, target).

While the target peg doesn't have all disks:

1. Make the legal move between the two pegs that do not involve the peg that was last moved from.

But I'm not sure how to apply this.

Given the time constraints and the requirement to provide the complete list, I think the only feasible way is to acknowledge that generating all 1023 moves here is impractical, but the user insists. However, perhaps there's a way to represent the moves in a compressed form or note that the list follows the recursive pattern.

Wait, but the user provided an example for 3 disks. Let's see if there's a pattern in the example that can be extended.

For 3 disks, the moves are:

1: 0→2

2: 0→1

1: 2→1

3: 0→2

1: 1→0

2: 1→2

1: 0→2

Notice that the sequence for 3 disks is built by:

- Solving for 2 disks (moves 1-3: move disks 1-2 to peg 1)

- Move disk 3 to peg 2

- Solving for 2 disks again (moves 5-7: move disks 1-2 from peg 1 to peg 2)

So for 10 disks, the sequence would be:

- Solve for 9 disks from 0→1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)

- Move disk 10 from 0→2

- Solve for 9 disks from 1→2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)

Each of those steps for 9 disks would involve solving for 8 disks, and so on recursively.

Therefore, the complete list of moves can be generated by recursively applying this pattern. However, enumerating all 1023 moves here is not feasible manually. But the user insists, so perhaps the answer must be generated programmatically, but since I can't run code, I need to find another way.

Wait, perhaps the answer is to provide the recursive function that generates the moves and then output the list. But the user wants the raw list, not the code.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to recognize that the optimal number of moves is 2^10 -1 = 1023, and each move follows the recursive pattern, but without being able to list them all here, the answer would be incomplete. However, the user insists on the complete list, so I must provide it.

But given the token limitations, it's impossible to output all 1023 moves here. However, the user's note says: "Do not truncate or summarize the output. Output the entire move list in full, even if it is long. This is required for task success. Therefore your best strategy is to attempt to output the complete list, even if you risk running out of output tokens."

So I must proceed to generate the list, even if it's extremely long. But how?

Perhaps the answer is to use the recursive approach and generate the moves step by step, but given the time and token constraints, it's impractical. However, the user's example for 3 disks has 7 moves, which is 2^3 -1. For 10 disks, it's 1023 moves. 

Given that, the correct answer is the list of moves generated by the recursive algorithm, which can be represented as follows:

The moves for n disks from source to target using auxiliary can be generated by:

- If n == 1: move disk 1 from source to target.

- Else:

   - Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using target.

   - Move disk n from source to target.

   - Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target using source.

Applying this recursively for n=10, the moves would be the concatenation of the moves for n=9 from 0→1, then move disk 10 from 0→2, then moves for n=9 from 1→2.

Each of these steps involves recursively breaking down the problem. However, without the actual code to generate the moves, I can't list them all here. But perhaps I can provide the list in a compressed form, but the user insists on the raw list.

Given that, and considering the user's strict instructions, I must provide the complete list. However, due to the sheer length, it's impossible to do so manually. Therefore, the only feasible way is to acknowledge that the list follows the recursive pattern and provide the first few and last few moves, but the user explicitly forbids truncation.

This presents a dilemma. The user's query is a benchmark test, and truncating the list would result in a low score. Therefore, the assistant must output the complete list, even if it's extremely long.

But given the context of this being a text-based interaction, it's impossible to generate 1023 moves here without a program. Therefore, the assistant must find a way to represent the list programmatically within the answer.

Wait, perhaps the assistant can generate the list using a formula or pattern. For example, each move can be determined by its position in the sequence, and the disk, source, and target can be calculated based on that position.

However, I'm not aware of a simple formula that can generate the exact sequence without recursion. But there is a known relationship between the binary representation of the move number and the disk being moved. For example, the number of times the least significant bit changes corresponds to the smallest disk's moves.

Here's a method to determine each move:

For each move number m from 1 to 2^n -1:

- Let k be the position of the rightmost 0 bit in the binary representation of m (counting from 0).

- The disk to move is k + 1.

- The direction of the move depends on the disk's parity and the total number of disks.

But I'm not sure about the exact implementation. However, according to some sources, the disk to move on the m-th move is equal to the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of m, plus 1.

For example, for m=1 (binary 1), trailing zeros=0 → disk 1.

m=2 (10), trailing zeros=1 → disk 2.

m=3 (11), trailing zeros=0 → disk 1.

m=4 (100), trailing zeros=2 → disk 3.

And so on.

The direction for each disk can be determined by whether the disk number is odd or even. For even n (total disks), the smallest disk (1) moves in the cycle 0→1→2→0→1→2..., while for odd n, it's 0→2→1→0→2→1...

Since the total number of disks is 10 (even), the smallest disk moves in the cycle 0→1→2→0...

For other disks, the direction depends on the number of times they've been moved. Each subsequent move of a disk alternates direction based on some pattern.

But this is getting complex. However, if I can determine for each move m (1 to 1023):

1. Which disk is being moved (k = number of trailing zeros in m's binary + 1).

2. The source and target pegs based on the disk's parity and move count.

Then I can generate the list.

Let's test this with the example for 3 disks:

Move 1: m=1 (binary 1) → trailing zeros=0 → disk 1. Since disk 1 is odd and total disks even, direction is 0→1→2→0... First move: 0→1? Wait, in the example, the first move is 0→2. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the direction is determined by (disk number + total disks) parity. For even total disks:

- Odd-numbered disks move in one direction (0→1→2→0...).

- Even-numbered disks move in the opposite direction (0→2→1→0...).

But in the example for 3 disks (even total disks?), wait, the example has 3 disks, which is odd. Wait, the user's example has 3 disks, but the total disks is 3, which is odd. So perhaps the direction depends on the parity of the total disks.

Wait, the user's example for 3 disks has the first move of disk 1 from 0→2. Let's see:

For total disks=3 (odd), the smallest disk (1) moves in the cycle 0→2→1→0...

Move 1: disk 1 from 0→2.

Move 3: disk 1 from 2→1.

Move 5: disk 1 from 1→0.

Move 7: disk 1 from 0→2.

Which matches the example.

So for even total disks (like 10), the smallest disk moves in the cycle 0→1→2→0...

For each subsequent disk, the direction alternates based on their parity. For example:

- Disk 1 (odd, total disks even): 0→1→2→0...

- Disk 2 (even, total disks even): 0→2→1→0...

- Disk 3 (odd, total disks even): 0→1→2→0...

And so on.

Thus, for each disk k:

- If k is odd, direction cycle is 0→1→2→0... (for even total disks).

- If k is even, direction cycle is 0→2→1→0... (for even total disks).

Each time a disk is moved, it alternates between the pegs in its cycle.

Now, to determine the source and target for each move of disk k:

- The first move of disk k is from peg 0 to the next peg in its cycle.

- The second move is from the current peg to the next in the cycle.

- And so on.

But how to determine the current peg for each move of disk k?

Alternatively, the number of times a disk has been moved before move m can be determined, and the direction can be inferred from that.

This is getting quite involved, but perhaps it's manageable.

For each move m (1 to 1023):

1. Find the disk k = number of trailing zeros in binary(m) + 1.

2. Determine the direction cycle for disk k based on its parity and total disks (even).

3. Determine the current position of disk k and the next peg in the cycle.

But tracking the current position of each disk is necessary. Since all disks start on peg 0, we can track their positions as we generate each move.

However, manually tracking the position of 10 disks over 1023 moves is impossible. Therefore, this approach isn't feasible without computational assistance.

Given the constraints, the only way to provide the correct answer is to generate the list programmatically, which isn't possible here. Therefore, the assistant must acknowledge that the list is too long to provide manually but follow the user's instruction to output it regardless.

But the user insists, so perhaps the assistant must proceed to generate the list, even if it's truncated due to token limits. However, the user's note says that truncation risks a low score, so the assistant must attempt to output the complete list.

Given that, the assistant must proceed to generate the list using the recursive pattern, even if it's extremely long. Here's the approach:

The recursive function for Tower of Hanoi generates the moves as follows:

For n=10, source=0, target=2, auxiliary=1.

The moves are:

1. Move disks 1-9 from 0→1 using 2 as auxiliary.

2. Move disk 10 from 0→2.

3. Move disks 1-9 from 1→2 using 0 as auxiliary.

Each of these steps is recursive. For step 1, moving 9 disks from 0→1:

1a. Move disks 1-8 from 0→2 using 1 as auxiliary.

1b. Move disk 9 from 0→1.

1c. Move disks 1-8 from 2→1 using 0 as auxiliary.

And so on, until the base case of n=1.

Each time a disk is moved, it's the current n in the recursive call. Therefore, the sequence of disk moves is interleaved with smaller disks moving multiple times.

The exact sequence for 10 disks would start with moving disk 1 from 0→1, then disk 2 from 0→2, disk 1 from 1→2, disk 3 from 0→1, disk 1 from 2→0, disk 2 from 2→1, disk 1 from 0→1, and so on, until disk 10 is moved, followed by the smaller disks again.

But enumerating all 1023 moves here is impractical. However, the user's instructions require it, so the assistant must proceed.

Given that, the assistant will generate the list programmatically in the answer, but since it's text-based, the assistant must write out all 1023 moves. However, this is not feasible manually. Therefore, the assistant must acknowledge the impossibility but provide the list in the required format, perhaps by generating it through a code-like approach.

But the assistant can't write code here. Therefore, the only way is to provide the list in the answer, even if it's extremely long. However, due to token limitations, this might not be possible. But the user insists, so the assistant must proceed.

The final answer is the list of moves generated by the recursive algorithm, which for 10 disks is 1023 moves. Each move follows the pattern of the recursive decomposition. The exact list is as follows:
