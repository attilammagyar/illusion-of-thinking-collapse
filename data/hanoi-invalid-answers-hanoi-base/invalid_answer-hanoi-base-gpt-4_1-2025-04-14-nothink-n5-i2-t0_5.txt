Let's solve the **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle for 5 disks, using pegs 0 (start), 1 (auxiliary), and 2 (goal).

### **Step-by-step Solution**

The recursive strategy for Tower of Hanoi is:
1. Move top \( n-1 \) disks from source to auxiliary.
2. Move largest disk from source to target.
3. Move \( n-1 \) disks from auxiliary to target.

Let's use this strategy and **list every move** as \([disk\#, from, to]\):
