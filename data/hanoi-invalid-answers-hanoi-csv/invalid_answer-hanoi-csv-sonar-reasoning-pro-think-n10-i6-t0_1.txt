Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 10 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any explanation, just the CSV format. First, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursion problem. The minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, so for 10 disks, that's 1023 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

The standard recursive solution involves moving the top n-1 disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg, then moving the nth disk to the target peg, and then moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary to the target. But generating all those moves step-by-step manually isn't feasible. However, there's an iterative approach mentioned in the search results. 

Looking at the Wikipedia entry (source [3]), the iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific direction each time. Since 10 is even, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move right each time. The iterative steps are: move disk 1, then make the only legal move not involving disk 1, and repeat.

But how to translate this into a sequence of moves for 10 disks? The example given for 3 disks in the query shows a specific pattern. Let's see if there's a pattern or formula to generate each move. Each move can be determined based on the number of disks and the step number. 

Another approach is to use the binary representation of the move numbers. Each move corresponds to a bit in binary, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the iterative method's steps can be programmed, but since I have to generate the list manually, I need a systematic way.

Wait, the user provided an example for 3 disks. Let's see that sequence again. For 3 disks, the moves are:

1,0,2
2,0,1
1,2,1
3,0,2
1,1,0
2,1,2
1,0,2

This follows the pattern of moving the smallest disk every other move. The iterative solution for even n (like 10) would have the smallest disk moving in a fixed direction each time. For even n, the first move of disk 1 is to peg 1, then peg 2, then peg 0, etc., but wait, in the example for 3 disks (odd), the first move is to peg 2. Hmm, maybe the direction depends on the parity of the number of disks. Since 10 is even, the smallest disk moves to the right (peg 1 first, then peg 2, then peg 0, etc.?).

But generating all 1023 moves manually is impossible. However, the search results mention that the minimum moves are 2^10 -1 = 1023. The user wants the complete list, so I need to find a way to output all these moves correctly. 

Looking at source [4], there's a video titled "Tower Of Hanoi 10 Discs Grand Solution." Maybe the moves are listed there, but since I can't watch the video, I have to rely on the algorithm. 

The iterative solution steps from Wikipedia: alternate between moving the smallest disk and the only possible non-smallest disk move. For even n, the smallest disk moves in a specific direction. Let's outline the steps:

1. Initialize the pegs. All disks start on peg 0.
2. Determine the direction for the smallest disk. For even n, move right (peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0...).
3. For each move:
   a. If it's an odd-numbered move, move the smallest disk (disk 1) in the determined direction.
   b. If it's even-numbered, make the only legal move possible that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

This pattern repeats until all disks are on peg 2. 

But how to track each move's from and to pegs? Let's try to simulate the first few moves for 10 disks to see the pattern.

Move 1: Smallest disk (1) moves from peg 0 to peg 1 (since n=10 is even, direction is right).
Move 2: The only legal move not involving disk 1 is moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.
Move 3: Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.
Move 4: Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1.
Move 5: Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0.
Move 6: Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1.
Move 7: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
Move 8: Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2.
... and so on.

This seems to follow a pattern where each even-numbered move involves moving the next available disk (not 1) in a way that follows the rules. However, generating all 1023 moves manually is impractical. But since the user insists, I need to find a way to output the correct sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the moves that can be represented algorithmically. For example, each disk's moves follow a certain pattern based on its size. The smallest disk moves every other move, and the direction depends on the disk's size parity. But I'm not sure.

Another approach is to use the recursive solution's steps and translate them into moves. For n disks, the sequence is:

- Move n-1 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2 as auxiliary.
- Move disk n from peg 0 to peg 2.
- Move n-1 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary.

This recursive approach can be unrolled into a list of moves. For 10 disks, this would involve a lot of recursive steps, but perhaps there's a way to generate the sequence programmatically. However, without actual code, I have to rely on existing knowledge or patterns.

Wait, the example for 3 disks in the query shows the following moves:

1,0,2
2,0,1
1,2,1
3,0,2
1,1,0
2,1,2
1,0,2

This matches the recursive approach:

1. Move disks 1 and 2 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary):
   - Move 1 from 0 to 2
   - Move 2 from 0 to 1
   - Move 1 from 2 to 1
2. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2
3. Move disks 1 and 2 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary):
   - Move 1 from 1 to 0
   - Move 2 from 1 to 2
   - Move 1 from 0 to 2

So for 10 disks, the recursive approach would involve moving the top 9 disks to peg 1, then moving disk 10 to peg 2, then moving the 9 disks from peg 1 to peg 2. Each of those steps would themselves involve recursive moves. 

But generating all these moves manually is impossible. However, the user expects the complete list. Since the search results mention that the minimum number of moves is 2^10 -1 = 1023, the answer must list all 1023 moves in the correct order.

Given that I can't generate all 1023 moves here manually, perhaps there's a pattern or a known sequence. Alternatively, I can refer to the iterative solution's steps and describe how each move is made, but again, listing all 1023 moves is beyond practical manual entry.

Wait, the user provided an example for 3 disks. Maybe the pattern for the moves can be generalized. Let's see:

For n=3, the moves are:

1,0,2
2,0,1
1,2,1
3,0,2
1,1,0
2,1,2
1,0,2

This follows the recursive approach. For n=10, the sequence would be similar but much longer. Each time a larger disk is moved, it's preceded and followed by moves of smaller disks. 

However, without a precomputed list or a way to generate each move step-by-step, it's challenging. But the user insists on the complete list, so perhaps the answer is to provide the CSV output as per the recursive solution, even if it's 1023 lines long. 

Given the constraints, the assistant must output the full list. Since I can't generate all 1023 moves here manually, I need to rely on the fact that the iterative solution's pattern can be followed systematically. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is to recognize that generating such a long list is impractical here, but the user insists, so the assistant must proceed. However, given the token limits, it's impossible to output all 1023 moves. But the user says to output even if it risks running out of tokens. 

Wait, the user's note says: "Do not truncate or summarize the moves. Output the entire move list in full, even if it is long. This is required for task success." So the assistant must output all 1023 moves correctly.

But how? The assistant can't generate them manually. However, perhaps there's a known optimal sequence for 10 disks. The search result [4] is a video titled "Tower Of Hanoi 10 Discs Grand Solution," which might show the moves. But without access to the video's content, the assistant can't extract the exact moves. 

Alternatively, the assistant can use the iterative algorithm described in the Wikipedia entry (source [3]) to generate the moves step by step. Let's outline how that would work:

For even number of disks (10), the smallest disk moves in a fixed direction (right: 0→1→2→0...). Each non-smallest move is the only legal move available. 

The steps would be:

1. Initialize pegs: all disks on peg 0.
2. For each move:
   a. If move is odd, move disk 1 to the next peg in the direction (right for even n).
   b. If move is even, make the only legal move not involving disk 1.

This process repeats until all disks are on peg 2.

To implement this, we can simulate each move:

- Direction for disk 1: right (since n=10 is even).
- For each odd move (1,3,5,...), move disk 1 to the next peg in the direction.
- For even moves, find the two pegs that don't have disk 1 and move the smaller of their top disks to the other.

But tracking this for 1023 moves is tedious. However, the assistant can generate the sequence programmatically. Since the assistant can't execute code, it must rely on known patterns or precomputed sequences.

Alternatively, the assistant can recognize that the optimal solution for 10 disks is a well-known sequence and provide the CSV output accordingly. However, without access to the exact move list, the assistant must construct it based on the algorithm.

Given the time constraints, the assistant will proceed to generate the initial moves and then recognize that the pattern continues, but since the user requires the full list, the assistant must output all 1023 moves. However, given the token limit, this might not be feasible. But the user insists, so the assistant must proceed.

The final answer will be the CSV list of all 1023 moves following the iterative approach for even n=10, ensuring each move is valid and follows the rules. Each line will be generated step by step, alternating moving disk 1 and the next possible disk. The assistant will simulate this process and output the complete list.
