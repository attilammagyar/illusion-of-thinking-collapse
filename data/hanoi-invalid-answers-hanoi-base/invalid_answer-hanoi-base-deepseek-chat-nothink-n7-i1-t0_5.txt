Alright, let's tackle the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 7 disks. I'll approach this step by step, making sure to follow the rules and keep track of each move. 

### Understanding the Problem
We have three pegs: Peg 0, Peg 1, and Peg 2. Initially, all 7 disks are on Peg 0, stacked from largest (7) at the bottom to smallest (1) at the top. The goal is to move all disks to Peg 2, following the rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Only the top disk of a stack can be moved.
3. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one.

### Strategy
The standard solution for the Tower of Hanoi involves recursion:
- To move `n` disks from Peg A to Peg C using Peg B as auxiliary:
  1. Move `n-1` disks from Peg A to Peg B using Peg C as auxiliary.
  2. Move the nth disk (the largest one) from Peg A to Peg C.
  3. Move the `n-1` disks from Peg B to Peg C using Peg A as auxiliary.

This strategy ensures that we never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one.

### Applying the Strategy to 7 Disks
Let's apply this step by step for 7 disks from Peg 0 to Peg 2, using Peg 1 as auxiliary.

#### Step 1: Move disks 1-6 from Peg 0 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.
This is equivalent to solving the problem for 6 disks from Peg 0 to Peg 1.

##### Sub-step 1.1: Move disks 1-5 from Peg 0 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.
