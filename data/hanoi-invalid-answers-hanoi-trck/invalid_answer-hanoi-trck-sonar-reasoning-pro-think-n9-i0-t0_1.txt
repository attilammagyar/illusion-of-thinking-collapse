Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 9 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation. First, I remember that the minimum number of moves required for n disks is 2^n - 1. For 9 disks, that's 2^9 - 1 = 511 moves. So the solution should have exactly 511 moves.

The standard recursive approach involves moving the top n-1 disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg, then moving the nth disk to the target peg, and finally moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary to the target. But since the user wants an explicit list, I need to generate each move step-by-step.

Looking at the search results, the iterative solution mentioned in Wikipedia [5] alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest moves in a specific pattern. Since 9 is odd, the smallest disk moves in the opposite direction each time. Wait, the iterative solution says that for an odd number of disks, the smallest moves to the right initially. But the example given in the search result [5] mentions that if the number of disks is odd, the stack ends up on peg B. But in this problem, the target is peg 2. Hmm, maybe the direction depends on the parity.

Alternatively, the solution might follow a pattern where each move of the smallest disk alternates between pegs in a specific order. For example, if starting with an odd number, the smallest disk moves in a cycle of peg 0 → peg 2 → peg 1 → peg 0, etc. But I need to confirm the exact pattern.

The example provided in the query for 3 disks shows a specific sequence. Let's analyze that. The initial state is [3,2,1], [], []. The solution moves are:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move 1 from 0 to 2

This follows the standard recursive method. For 3 disks, the moves alternate between the smallest and the next available. The iterative approach for odd disks would have the smallest disk moving in a specific direction each time.

But generating all 511 moves manually is impractical. Instead, I need to find a pattern or algorithm that can generate each move step by step. The iterative solution from [5] suggests alternating between moving the smallest disk and the next possible disk. For each step:

- If the move number is odd, move the smallest disk (disk 1) in the prescribed direction.
- If the move number is even, make the only valid move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

The direction for the smallest disk depends on the total number of disks. Since 9 is odd, according to [5], the smallest disk moves in a specific direction. Wait, the Wikipedia entry says that for the iterative solution, if the number of disks is even, the smallest moves to the right (peg 0 → 1 → 2 → 0), and if odd, to the left (peg 0 → 2 → 1 → 0). But in the example with 3 disks (odd), the smallest disk moves from 0→2, then 2→1, then 1→0, etc. So the direction alternates each time.

So for 9 disks (odd), the smallest disk moves in the sequence 0→2, 2→1, 1→0, repeating. For each odd-numbered move, we move the smallest disk in this cycle. Then, for even-numbered moves, we move the only possible non-smallest disk that can be moved.

To generate all moves, I can simulate this process. Start with all disks on peg 0. For each move:

1. If the move number is odd (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.), move the smallest disk (1) to the next peg in the cycle (0→2→1→0...).
2. If the move number is even, move the next possible disk that's not the smallest and can be legally moved.

This requires keeping track of the state of each peg after each move. Since doing this manually for 511 steps is error-prone, I need to find a systematic way to generate each move.

Alternatively, the recursive approach can be used to generate the sequence. For moving n disks from source to target using auxiliary:

- Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.
- Move nth disk from source to target.
- Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target.

Each of these steps would involve recursive calls. For 9 disks, this would generate the correct sequence. However, translating this into the explicit list of moves requires understanding the order in which the disks are moved.

But given the user's requirement for the exact move list, I need to ensure that each move is correctly ordered. The search result [3] mentions an algorithm where for odd disks, you alternate moving disk 1 and then another disk, following specific steps. The example in [3] for 3 disks aligns with the standard solution.

Given the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to follow the iterative method described in [5], which alternates between moving the smallest disk and the only possible non-smallest disk. Let's outline the steps:

1. Initialize pegs: peg0 has [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], peg1 and peg2 empty.
2. For each move from 1 to 511:
   a. If move is odd, move disk 1 to the next peg in the cycle (0→2→1→0...).
   b. If move is even, find the two pegs that don't have disk 1, and move the smaller of the top disks on those pegs to the other peg.

Wait, but how to determine the non-smallest disk move? The even moves involve moving the only possible disk that's not 1 and can be moved. For example, after moving disk 1, the next move must be between the two other pegs, moving the smaller of their top disks (if any) onto the other.

This process can be automated, but manually generating 511 steps is tedious. However, the user insists on the complete list. Given that the search results [1] and [2] show videos of 9-disk solutions taking 511 moves, and [4] confirms the formula, the solution must follow this pattern.

Since I can't generate all 511 moves here manually, perhaps the answer is to provide the iterative steps following the algorithm, ensuring that each move adheres to the rules. Each odd move moves disk 1 in the cycle 0→2→1→0..., and each even move moves the next possible disk between the other two pegs.

For example, the first few moves would be:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 2 (odd move)
2. Move 2 from 0 to 1 (even move)
3. Move 1 from 2 to 1 (odd move)
4. Move 3 from 0 to 2 (even move)
5. Move 1 from 1 to 0 (odd move)
6. Move 2 from 1 to 2 (even move)
7. Move 1 from 0 to 2 (odd move)
8. Move 4 from 0 to 1 (even move)
...

Continuing this pattern until all disks are on peg 2.

However, ensuring that each even move correctly moves the next available disk requires tracking the state after each move. Since this is a systematic process, the full list can be generated programmatically. But since I have to write it out, I need to follow the pattern accurately.

Given the constraints, the correct answer is the complete list of 511 moves following the iterative algorithm. Each odd move moves disk 1 in the cycle, and each even move moves the smallest possible disk between the other two pegs.

The final answer must list all 511 moves in the specified format, with each move's from_peg, to_peg, and the state of all pegs after the move. This is a lengthy process, but adhering to the algorithm ensures correctness.
