Alright, let's tackle the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 8 disks. I'll approach this step by step, making sure to follow the rules and keep track of each move.

### Understanding the Problem

We have three pegs: Peg 0, Peg 1, and Peg 2. Initially, all 8 disks are stacked on Peg 0 in descending order of size (Disk 8 at the bottom to Disk 1 at the top). The goal is to move all disks to Peg 2 following the rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Only the top disk from any stack can be moved.
3. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

### Strategy

The standard solution for the Tower of Hanoi involves recursion. Here's how it works for `n` disks:

1. Move the top `n-1` disks from the starting peg to the auxiliary peg (not the target peg).
2. Move the nth disk (the largest one) from the starting peg to the target peg.
3. Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.

For our case, the starting peg is Peg 0, the target peg is Peg 2, and the auxiliary peg is Peg 1.

### Step-by-Step Moves

Let's generate the moves for 8 disks. I'll keep track of each move and the state of the pegs after each move.
