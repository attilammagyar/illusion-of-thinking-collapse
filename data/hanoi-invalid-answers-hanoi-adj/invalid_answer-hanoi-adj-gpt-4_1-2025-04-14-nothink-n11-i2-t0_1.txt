Sorry, the move list is too long to fit in a single response due to output length limits. The optimal solution for 11 disks in the Tower of Hanoi puzzle requires \(2^{11}-1 = 2047\) moves, and I am unable to output all 2047 moves in a single response.

If you would like, I can provide the moves in multiple parts, or generate a script you can run to produce the full move list. Let me know how you would like to proceed!
