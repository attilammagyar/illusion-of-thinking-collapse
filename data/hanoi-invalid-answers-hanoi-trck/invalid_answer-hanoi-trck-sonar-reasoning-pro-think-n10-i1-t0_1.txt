Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 10 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation. First, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi problem is classically solved using recursion. The minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, so for 10 disks, that's 1023 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

The standard recursive approach involves moving the top n-1 disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg, then moving the nth disk to the target peg, and finally moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg. However, generating all these moves step-by-step manually would be error-prone. But since the user provided some search results, maybe there's an iterative solution mentioned.

Looking at the search results, result [4] mentions an iterative solution where you alternate moves between the smallest piece and a non-smallest piece. The direction depends on whether the number of disks is even or odd. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Since we have 10 disks (even), the smallest disk (1) should move in a consistent direction each time, probably rightwards.

The iterative algorithm steps are:
1. Move the smallest disk to the next peg in the direction (right for even).
2. Make the only valid move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.
3. Repeat until all disks are on the target peg.

But implementing this requires tracking each move. Since the user wants the exact sequence, perhaps there's a pattern or a known sequence for 10 disks. The search results [2] and [1] mention solutions for 10 disks, but they're video links. Without watching the videos, I can't extract the exact moves. However, the Wikipedia entry [4] and the Futurum Careers article [5] confirm the formula and the recursive method.

Given that the user wants the raw list, I need to generate each move step-by-step. However, manually writing out 1023 moves is impractical here. But maybe there's a systematic way to represent the moves. The iterative approach can be programmed, but since I can't execute code, I have to rely on the known pattern.

For the iterative solution with even n (10), the smallest disk moves cyclically to the right (peg 0 → 1 → 2 → 0...). Each non-smallest move is determined by the only legal move available. 

Let me try to outline the first few moves to see the pattern:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (smallest move right).
2. Move the next possible disk (smallest non-1). The only options are moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (since peg 1 has disk 1, which is smaller).
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2.
... and so on.

This follows the iterative pattern. Each even-numbered move (excluding the first) involves moving the next smallest disk available. However, tracking this for 10 disks would require generating each move correctly. 

But generating all 1023 moves here is impossible due to token limits. However, the user insists on the complete list, so I must provide it. But how? Maybe there's a way to represent the moves algorithmically and then output them in the required format.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution can be represented as a series of moves following the binary representation or using the Gray code sequence, where each move corresponds to a bit flip. Each disk move corresponds to a specific bit in the binary counter, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the standard solution for Tower of Hanoi is that each move corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of the move number. For each move, the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move number. For example, move 1 (binary 1) has 0 trailing zeros, so move disk 1. Move 2 (10) has 1 trailing zero, move disk 2, etc.

The direction for each disk depends on whether the disk number is even or odd. For even n (10), the directions alternate. Disk 1 (smallest) moves right (0→1→2→0...). Disk 2 moves in the opposite direction, but since it's even, maybe left? Wait, the direction for each disk is determined by the parity of the disk number. For even-numbered disks, the direction is opposite to the smallest disk. Since the smallest disk (1) is odd, it moves right. Disk 2 (even) would move left. But this might vary based on the total number of disks.

Alternatively, the direction for each disk is determined by whether the total number of disks is even or odd. Since we have 10 disks (even), the smallest disk moves right, and each subsequent disk alternates direction. But I need to confirm.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to generate the moves step by step using the iterative algorithm, ensuring that each move follows the rules. Let's attempt to outline the first few moves and see if a pattern emerges that can be extrapolated.

Starting with all disks on peg 0:

Move 1: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (smallest move right).
Pegs: 0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2], 1: [1], 2: []

Move 2: Move the smallest non-1 disk. The only legal move is disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (can't go to peg 1 because 1 is smaller than 2).
Pegs: 0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3], 1: [1], 2: [2]

Move 3: Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2 (smallest move right again).
Pegs: 0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3], 1: [], 2: [2,1]

Move 4: Move the next non-1 disk. The only legal move is disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1 (can't move disk 2 from peg 2 because it's under disk 1).
Pegs: 0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,4], 1: [3], 2: [2,1]

Move 5: Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0 (since after moving disk 3, the next smallest move is right, but peg 2 is at the end, so wrap around to peg 0).
Pegs: 0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,1], 1: [3], 2: [2]

Move 6: Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1 (since disk 2 is smaller than disk 3 on peg 1).
Pegs: 0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,1], 1: [3,2], 2: []

Move 7: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (smallest move right).
Pegs: 0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,4], 1: [3,2,1], 2: []

Move 8: Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2 (next non-1 disk).
Pegs: 0: [10,9,8,7,6,5], 1: [3,2,1], 2: [4]

Move 9: Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.
Pegs: 0: [10,9,8,7,6,5], 1: [3,2], 2: [4,1]

Move 10: Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0.
Pegs: 0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,2], 1: [3], 2: [4,1]

Move 11: Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0.
Pegs: 0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,2,1], 1: [3], 2: [4]

Move 12: Move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2.
Pegs: 0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,2,1], 1: [], 2: [4,3]

Move 13: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
Pegs: 0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,2], 1: [1], 2: [4,3]

Move 14: Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (since peg 2 has 4, which is larger than 2).
Pegs: 0: [10,9,8,7,6,5], 1: [1], 2: [4,3,2]

Move 15: Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.
Pegs: 0: [10,9,8,7,6,5], 1: [], 2: [4,3,2,1]

Move 16: Move disk 5 from peg 0 to peg 1.
... and this pattern continues, with each even step moving the next disk and odd steps moving disk 1.

However, generating all 1023 moves manually is impossible here. The user provided search results include a video [2] titled "Tower Of Hanoi 10 Discs Grand Solution" which likely shows the entire sequence. But without access to the video's content, I can't transcribe the moves. Similarly, the Wikipedia article [4] mentions the iterative solution but doesn't list all moves.

Given the constraints, the correct approach is to follow the iterative algorithm, ensuring each move adheres to the rules. Since the user requires the complete list, I must generate it programmatically. However, as an AI, I can't execute code, but I can outline the algorithm and then attempt to generate the moves step-by-step.

But given the token limit, even attempting to list all 1023 moves would exceed the allowed response length. However, the user explicitly stated not to truncate and to output the complete list, even risking token limits. Therefore, I must proceed to generate the moves following the iterative method, ensuring each move is correct.

The iterative algorithm for an even number of disks (10) is as follows:

1. Make the legal move between pegs A and B (in either direction).
2. Make the legal move between pegs A and C (in either direction).
3. Make the legal move between pegs B and C (in either direction).
4. Repeat until all disks are on peg C.

But this might not be the exact steps. Alternatively, the standard iterative approach is:

- For even n: the smallest disk moves right (A→B→C→A...).
- For each non-smallest move, there's only one legal option.

Following this, each move of the smallest disk is in a cycle, and the other moves are determined by the only possible legal move.

To generate the list, I can simulate each move:

Initialize pegs:
peg0 = [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
peg1 = []
peg2 = []

moves = []

direction = 1 (right) for even n.

For each move:
- If it's an odd move number, move the smallest disk (1) in the current direction.
- If it's even, make the only legal move not involving the smallest disk.

But tracking this for 1023 steps is tedious. However, the pattern repeats every three moves for the smallest disk. Let's try to generate the first few moves correctly and see if a pattern emerges that can be extrapolated.

Move 1: Move disk 1 from 0 to 1 (direction right).
peg0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2], peg1: [1], peg2: []

Move 2: Move disk 2 from 0 to 2 (only legal move not involving disk 1).
peg0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3], peg1: [1], peg2: [2]

Move 3: Move disk 1 from 1 to 2 (direction right).
peg0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3], peg1: [], peg2: [2,1]

Move 4: Move disk 3 from 0 to 1 (only legal move).
peg0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,4], peg1: [3], peg2: [2,1]

Move 5: Move disk 1 from 2 to 0 (since direction is right, next after 2 is 0).
peg0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,1], peg1: [3], peg2: [2]

Move 6: Move disk 2 from 2 to 1 (only legal move, as 2 < 3).
peg0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,1], peg1: [3,2], peg2: []

Move 7: Move disk 1 from 0 to 1 (direction right).
peg0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,4], peg1: [3,2,1], peg2: []

Move 8: Move disk 4 from 0 to 2 (only legal move).
peg0: [10,9,8,7,6,5], peg1: [3,2,1], peg2: [4]

Move 9: Move disk 1 from 1 to 2 (direction right).
peg0: [10,9,8,7,6,5], peg1: [3,2], peg2: [4,1]

Move 10: Move disk 2 from 1 to 0 (only legal move, since 2 can't go on 4).
peg0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,2], peg1: [3], peg2: [4,1]

Move 11: Move disk 1 from 2 to 0 (direction right would be peg 2 → 0, since after 2 comes 0).
peg0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,2,1], peg1: [3], peg2: [4]

Move 12: Move disk 3 from 1 to 2 (only legal move, 3 < 4).
peg0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,2,1], peg1: [], peg2: [4,3]

Move 13: Move disk 1 from 0 to 1 (direction right).
peg0: [10,9,8,7,6,5,2], peg1: [1], peg2: [4,3]

Move 14: Move disk 2 from 0 to 2 (can place on 3, which is larger).
peg0: [10,9,8,7,6,5], peg1: [1], peg2: [4,3,2]

Move 15: Move disk 1 from 1 to 2 (direction right).
peg0: [10,9,8,7,6,5], peg1: [], peg2: [4,3,2,1]

Move 16: Move disk 5 from 0 to 1 (only legal move).
peg0: [10,9,8,7,6], peg1: [5], peg2: [4,3,2,1]

... and this continues. Each time, the smallest disk moves right, and the other moves are determined by the only possible legal move. The pattern repeats, with each larger disk moving every 2^(disk number) steps. For example, disk 1 moves every other move, disk 2 every 4 moves, disk 3 every 8 moves, etc.

However, generating all 1023 moves in this format would require a systematic approach. Since I can't execute code here, I need to find a way to represent the moves correctly. 

Given the user's insistence on the complete list and the format requirements, I must proceed to generate each move step-by-step, ensuring that each move adheres to the rules and the peg states are correctly updated. This will take a significant amount of time and tokens, but the user has explicitly requested it.

Starting from move 1 to move 1023, each move will be recorded with the move ID, from_peg, to_peg, and the state of each peg after the move. Given the complexity, I'll start generating the moves in the specified format, carefully checking each step to avoid errors. However, due to the sheer number of moves, this process will be extensive.
