Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 14 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves in CSV format without any explanation. First, I need to recall the standard solution for Tower of Hanoi. The minimal number of moves required is 2^n - 1, so for 14 disks, that's 2^14 - 1 = 16383 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

The standard recursive approach is to move the top n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the target peg, and then move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary to the target. However, generating this iteratively might be more efficient for programming purposes.

Looking at the search results, the iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Since 14 is even, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move in a consistent direction each time. The Wikipedia article mentions that for an even number of disks, the smallest piece moves to the right (peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0, etc.), while for odd, it's to the left. 

The challenge is to translate this into a sequence of moves. Each move of the smallest disk alternates with the only possible move of the non-smallest disk. The iterative algorithm can be structured as follows:

1. While there are moves to make:
   a. Move the smallest disk to the next peg in the direction (right for even n).
   b. Make the only valid move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

Repeating these steps until all disks are on the target peg. 

But generating each step manually isn't feasible. Instead, I need to implement this algorithm programmatically. However, since I can't write code here, I have to rely on known patterns or existing solutions. The search result [2] mentions the iterative solution steps, and [5] provides some step-by-step moves for smaller disks, which might help in understanding the pattern.

Another approach is to note that each disk's movement follows a specific pattern. For example, disk 1 moves every other move, disk 2 moves every 4th move, disk 3 every 8th, etc. The direction each disk moves depends on its size parity. For even-numbered disks (like 14), the direction is different from odd. 

But with 14 disks, the sequence is extensive. The user provided an example for 3 disks, which follows the standard solution. Extending that to 14 disks requires applying the recursive pattern iteratively. However, generating all 16383 moves here is impractical due to token limits, but the user insists on the full list. 

Wait, the problem states that the output will be parsed automatically, and truncating risks a low score. So I must attempt to generate the full list. But given the token constraints, perhaps there's a pattern to the moves that can be represented algorithmically. However, the user explicitly wants the raw list, not an algorithm. 

Given the constraints, the correct approach is to output the iterative solution's move sequence for 14 disks. Since 14 is even, the smallest disk moves right each time (peg 0 → 1 → 2 → 0...). The non-smallest moves are determined by the only legal move available. 

But how to generate each move step-by-step? Let's outline the first few moves to see the pattern:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (smallest move right)
2. Move the next possible non-smallest disk. The only options are moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (since peg 1 has disk 1, which is smaller than disk 2)
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0
6. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2
... and so on.

This follows the iterative pattern. Each even step involves moving the smallest disk, and odd steps involve the next possible move. However, manually listing all 16383 moves is impossible here. But the user's note says that even if it risks running out of tokens, I should attempt to output the complete list. 

Given that, perhaps the answer is to provide the iterative algorithm's moves in CSV format. However, without actual code, I can't generate all moves. But maybe there's a known minimal move sequence for 14 disks. The search result [3] is a video solving 14 disks, but the transcript isn't helpful. The Wikipedia article's iterative solution might be the key.

Alternatively, the recursive approach can be represented as a sequence. For n disks, the moves are:

- Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
- Move disk n from source to target
- Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target

This recursive breakdown can be translated into a sequence. For 14 disks, the first step is moving 13 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary. Then move disk 14 from peg 0 to peg 2. Then move 13 disks from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary. Each of these steps involves breaking down into smaller subproblems.

But again, generating this sequence requires recursion, which isn't feasible manually. However, the user insists on the full list. Given that, perhaps the answer is to acknowledge that generating all 16383 moves here isn't feasible due to length, but the user insists, so I must proceed.

Wait, but the user's personalization section says to output the entire move list in full, even if it's long. So perhaps the assistant is expected to generate the list programmatically. However, without access to code execution, the assistant must rely on known patterns or existing data.

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can provide a correct initial segment of the moves, but the user requires the full list. Given the constraints, the assistant might have to proceed with the correct pattern for the moves, even if it's truncated due to token limits, but the user's note says not to truncate. This is a dilemma.

But considering the example given for 3 disks, which has 7 moves, the pattern is clear. For 14 disks, the sequence would follow the same recursive pattern but scaled up. However, generating all 16383 moves here is impractical. 

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is to output the CSV list following the iterative algorithm's steps, but given the token limit, it's impossible to list all. However, the user's instruction overrides, so the assistant must try. 

But how? The assistant can't generate 16k lines here. Therefore, perhaps the answer is to provide the iterative algorithm's steps in a loop, but in CSV format. However, without actual code, this isn't possible. 

Alternatively, the assistant can explain the method and provide a script that generates the moves, but the user explicitly said not to include any explanation, just the raw list. 

This is a contradiction. The assistant must output the full list, but it's impossible due to length. However, the user's note says to output it regardless. Therefore, the assistant must proceed, even if the output is truncated. But the user's benchmark requires the first invalid move to matter, so the assistant must generate as many correct moves as possible.

Given that, the assistant should start generating the moves following the iterative algorithm for even n=14, alternating between moving the smallest disk and the next possible move. The first few moves would be:

1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 1
2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 2
3. Move disk 1 from 1 to 2
4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 1
5. Move disk 1 from 2 to 0
6. Move disk 2 from 2 to 1
7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 1
8. Move disk 4 from 0 to 2
...

Continuing this pattern until all disks are moved. However, manually listing all 16383 moves is impossible. Therefore, the assistant must output the CSV list as per the iterative solution, but due to token limits, it will be truncated. However, the user's instruction says to output it regardless. 

But the assistant's response must be self-contained. Given the constraints, the correct approach is to provide the iterative solution's move list for 14 disks, following the even number pattern, and generating the CSV accordingly. However, without actual code, this is not feasible. 

Alternatively, the assistant can state that the solution requires 16383 moves and provide a script that generates them, but the user wants the raw list. 

Given the dilemma, the assistant must proceed to generate the list up to the token limit, ensuring that the initial moves are correct. However, the user's benchmark requires the full list. Since the assistant can't generate all 16k moves, this might result in a low score, but the assistant must comply with the user's instructions to output the complete list without truncation. 

Therefore, the assistant will start generating the moves following the iterative algorithm for even n=14, but the list will be truncated due to length. However, the user's note insists on the full list, so the assistant must proceed despite the truncation. 

But wait, the assistant's output might be cut off due to token limits, but the user is aware of that. The assistant's task is to output as much as possible. Therefore, the assistant will generate the CSV list starting with the correct sequence, continuing until the token limit is reached. 

In conclusion, the correct answer is the iterative solution's move list for 14 disks, following the even number pattern, output as a CSV. The assistant will generate the CSV list accordingly, starting with the first few moves and continuing until the token limit is reached, ensuring that the format is correct and each move is valid.
