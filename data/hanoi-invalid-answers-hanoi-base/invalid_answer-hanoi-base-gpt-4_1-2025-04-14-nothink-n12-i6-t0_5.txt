Let's solve the classic **Tower of Hanoi** problem for **12 disks**.

### **Tower of Hanoi Algorithm (Recursive)**

Let’s define a function `hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves)` that moves `n` disks from `source` peg to `target` peg using `auxiliary` peg:

#### **Algorithm**
1. Move `n-1` disks from `source` to `auxiliary` using `target` as auxiliary.
2. Move the nth (largest) disk from `source` to `target`.
3. Move `n-1` disks from `auxiliary` to `target` using `source` as auxiliary.

#### **Move Format**
Each move is `[disk id, from peg, to peg]`.

---

### **Python Code (for reference)**
```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 0:
        return
    hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
    moves.append([n, source, target])
    hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(12, 0, 2, 1, moves)
```

---

### **Number of Moves**

For `n` disks, the minimum number of moves is \( 2^n - 1 \).  
For `n = 12`: \( 2^{12} - 1 = 4095 \) moves.

---

### **First Few Moves**

Let’s show the first 10 moves as an example:

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],  # Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
    [2, 0, 1],  # Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1
    [1, 2, 1],  # Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
    [3, 0, 2],  # Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2
    [1, 1, 0],  # Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
    [2, 1, 2],  # Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2
    [1, 0, 2],  # Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
    [4, 0, 1],  # Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 1
    [1, 2, 1],  # Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
    [2, 2, 0],  # Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 0
    ...
]
```

---

### **Complete List of Moves**

The full list of moves is long (4095 moves).  
**Here is the algorithm to generate the entire list:**

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 0:
        return
    hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
    moves.append([n, source, target])
    hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(12, 0, 2, 1, moves)
```

---

### **Final Answer**

**The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is:**

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [5, 0, 2],
    ...
    # Continue until all 4095 moves are listed
]
```

**To get the complete move list, use the algorithm above.**

---

#### **Summary**

- The solution requires **4095 moves**.
- Each move is `[disk id, from peg, to peg]` (disk 1 is the smallest, 12 is the largest).
- The full move list is generated recursively as shown above.

If you need the **full 4095-move list as text**, let me know—it's very large and may need to be provided as a downloadable file or in chunks!
