Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 11 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the standard rules. Since it's 11 disks, which is an odd number, I remember from the search results that the smallest disk (disk 1) moves in a specific cycle. For odd numbers of disks, the smallest disk cycles through pegs in the order 0 → 2 → 1 → 0, and so on. 

The optimal solution requires 2^11 - 1 moves, which is 2047 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list. The Gray code method mentioned in the sources might be useful here. Each move corresponds to a bit change in the Gray code sequence, indicating which disk to move. The disk to move is determined by the number of times the move number can be divided by 2. 

Wait, the Gray code solution says that the ordinal of the disk to move during move m is the number of times m can be divided by 2. So for each move, we count how many times m is divisible by 2, which gives the disk number (starting from 0). But since our disks are numbered starting from 1 (smallest) to 11 (largest), maybe we need to adjust that. Let me check the example given in the search results. The example with 3 disks uses moves starting with disk 1, so perhaps the disk number is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move number. For example, move 1 in binary is 1, which has 0 trailing zeros, so disk 1. Move 2 is 10, which has 1 trailing zero, so disk 2. Move 3 is 11, 0 trailing zeros, disk 1 again. That makes sense.

So for each move from 1 to 2047, we determine the disk to move by counting the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move number. Then, for the direction, since there are 11 disks (odd), the smallest disk moves in the cycle 0 → 2 → 1 → 0, etc. For other disks, the movement is determined by the parity of the disk number. Wait, the search result mentions that for the smallest disk, there are two possibilities, but the direction is determined by the number of disks. For odd n, the smallest disk cycles f → t → r → f..., where f is the starting peg (0), t is the target (2), and r is the remaining (1). So each move of the smallest disk alternates between peg 0, 2, 1, 0, etc.

For larger disks, since they can only move when there's a valid peg available. The algorithm for larger disks is to move them to the only possible peg that's not the current peg of the smallest disk. Alternatively, the Gray code method might handle this by determining the direction based on the disk's parity. 

Alternatively, the recursive solution: To move n disks from peg A to peg C, you move n-1 disks from A to B, then move the nth disk from A to C, then move n-1 disks from B to C. But generating the move list recursively for 11 disks would require a lot of steps, and it's not feasible to write out all 2047 moves manually. However, the user wants the list, so perhaps the Gray code approach is more systematic.

Let me outline the steps using the Gray code method:

1. For each move m from 1 to 2047:
   a. Determine the disk to move by finding the number of trailing zeros in m's binary representation. This gives k, and the disk is k+1 (since disks are numbered starting from 1). Wait, in the example with 3 disks, move 1 (binary 1) has 0 trailing zeros, so disk 1. Move 2 (10) has 1 trailing zero, disk 2. Move 3 (11) has 0 trailing zeros, disk 1. So yes, disk number is (number of trailing zeros in m) + 1.

2. Determine the direction for the disk:
   - For the smallest disk (disk 1), the direction cycles based on the total number of disks. Since 11 is odd, the cycle is 0 → 2 → 1 → 0...
   - For other disks (even-numbered disks?), the direction depends on whether the disk is even or odd. Wait, the search result says that for the smallest disk, the direction is determined by the parity of the number of disks. For other disks, there's only one possible move each time they are moved. 

Wait, the search result [1] says: "If the number of disks is odd, the smallest disk cycles along the pegs in the order f → t → r → f → t → r, etc. If the number of disks is even, this must be reversed: f → r → t → f → r → t, etc." Here, f is the starting peg (0), t is the target (2), and r is the remaining peg (1). So for 11 disks (odd), the smallest disk moves 0 → 2 → 1 → 0 → 2 → 1, etc.

For other disks, when they are moved, they must go to the only other peg that's not the current peg of the smallest disk. Alternatively, the direction alternates based on the disk's size. For example, disk 2 (the second smallest) moves every other time, and its direction is determined by some rule. 

Alternatively, the Gray code method's second part: once the disk is determined, the direction is found by looking at the current state. But this might be complex. 

Alternatively, using the iterative approach:

- For even-numbered disks, make the legal move between the two pegs that are not the current peg of the smallest disk.
- For odd-numbered disks, the direction is determined by the cycle.

Wait, perhaps the standard iterative algorithm is:

1. Make the legal move between pegs A and B (in either direction).
2. Make the legal move between pegs A and C.
3. Make the legal move between pegs B and C.
4. Repeat until complete.

But this might not be directly applicable. 

Alternatively, the iterative approach for Tower of Hanoi is as follows:

- The smallest disk moves every other move.
- The sequence of moves is determined by the following:
   - For an odd number of disks:
      - Move the smallest disk clockwise (0 → 2 → 1 → 0...)
   - For an even number of disks:
      - Move the smallest disk counter-clockwise (0 → 1 → 2 → 0...)
   - For each non-smallest disk move, there's only one possible move.

Given that we have 11 disks (odd), the smallest disk moves clockwise: 0 → 2 → 1 → 0...

So the algorithm would be:

- Initialize the pegs with all disks on peg 0.
- For each move until done:
   - If it's an odd-numbered move (1st, 3rd, etc.), move the smallest disk (disk 1) to the next peg in the cycle (0 → 2 → 1 → 0...)
   - If it's an even-numbered move, move the non-smallest disk that can be legally moved.

But generating all 2047 moves this way would require simulating each step. However, since the user wants the complete list, I need to generate it programmatically. But since I can't write code here, I have to find a pattern or formula.

Alternatively, using the Gray code approach, each move corresponds to a binary-reflected Gray code, where each bit change represents a disk move. The position of the changed bit indicates which disk to move. The direction is determined by the parity of the number of disks and the disk's size.

But perhaps the most straightforward way is to use the recursive approach, even though it's tedious. The recursive solution for moving n disks from source to target using auxiliary peg is:

- Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.
- Move nth disk from source to target.
- Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target.

This would generate the moves in the correct order. For 11 disks, the sequence would be:

Move 1 from 0 to 2
Move 2 from 0 to 1
Move 1 from 2 to 1
Move 3 from 0 to 2
Move 1 from 1 to 0
Move 2 from 1 to 2
Move 1 from 0 to 2
... and so on.

But writing out all 2047 moves manually is impossible. However, the user insists on the complete list, so I need to find a way to generate it. Since the search results mention the Gray code solution, perhaps I can use that method to generate each move step by step.

Let's try to outline the steps using the Gray code method:

For each move m from 1 to 2^11 - 1 = 2047:

1. Determine the disk to move:
   - Find the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of m. Let's call this k.
   - The disk to move is k + 1. For example, m=1 (binary 1) has 0 trailing zeros → disk 1. m=2 (10) has 1 trailing zero → disk 2. m=3 (11) → 0 trailing zeros → disk 1, etc.

2. Determine the direction for the disk:
   - For disk 1 (smallest), the direction cycles based on the number of disks. Since 11 is odd, the order is 0 → 2 → 1 → 0...
   - For other disks (k+1 > 1), the direction is determined by the parity of the number of times the disk has been moved before. Alternatively, the direction alternates between two pegs. Wait, the search result [1] says that for other disks, there's only one possible move each time they are moved. So once the disk is determined, the from and to pegs can be found by checking the current positions.

But simulating this for 2047 moves is impractical manually. However, perhaps there's a pattern. For example, the moves for disk 1 alternate between 0→2, 2→1, 1→0, etc. For disk 2, it moves every 2 moves, and the direction alternates between 0→1, 1→2, 2→0, etc. Wait, but this might not hold for all disks.

Alternatively, the direction for each disk larger than 1 is determined by the parity of the disk's number. For even-numbered disks, the direction is different than for odd-numbered disks. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the direction for non-smallest disks is determined by the following rule: the disk must move to the peg that is neither the current peg nor the peg where the smallest disk is. Since the smallest disk is moving in a cycle, the other disks have only one possible move each time they are moved.

But this requires tracking the current position of each disk, which is complex. However, given that the initial configuration is all disks on peg 0, and the target is peg 2, perhaps there's a systematic way to generate the moves.

Given the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to use the recursive method and generate the moves step by step. However, since I can't write code here, I need to find a pattern or formula that can be applied iteratively.

Another approach: The Tower of Hanoi solution can be represented as a state transition where each move follows the rules. The optimal solution for n disks has 2^n - 1 moves. For each move, the disk to move and the direction can be determined by the move number's properties.

Using the Gray code method, each move corresponds to a single bit change in the Gray code sequence. The position of the changed bit indicates the disk to move. For example, the first move (1) in Gray code is 001, which changes the least significant bit, corresponding to disk 1. The second move (3) in Gray code is 011, changing the second bit, corresponding to disk 2, and so on.

But how does this translate to the actual moves? The direction for each disk is determined by the parity of the number of times the disk has been moved. For disk 1, as mentioned, it cycles through pegs 0→2→1→0... For disk 2, it alternates between 0→1, 1→2, 2→0, etc., but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the direction for each disk can be determined by the following:

- For disk d (starting from 1), if d is odd, it moves in the same cycle as the smallest disk (0→2→1→0... for odd n). If d is even, it moves in the opposite cycle (0→1→2→0...). But this might depend on the total number of disks.

Wait, the search result [1] mentions that for the smallest disk, the direction depends on the parity of the number of disks. For other disks, the direction is determined by the parity of the disk's size. For example, if the disk is even-numbered, it moves in one direction, and if odd-numbered, another. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, the direction for non-smallest disks is determined by the following rule: each time a disk is moved, it must go to the only other peg that is not the current peg of the smallest disk. Since the smallest disk is moving in a cycle, the other disks have to move to the remaining peg.

But this requires knowing where the smallest disk is at each move. For example, when the smallest disk is on peg 2, the next non-smallest disk move must be between pegs 0 and 1.

This seems complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern. Let's consider the example given in the search results for 3 disks:

moves=[[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2]]

Breaking this down:

Move 1: disk 1 from 0→2
Move 2: disk 2 from 0→1
Move 3: disk 1 from 2→1
Move 4: disk 3 from 0→2
Move 5: disk 1 from 1→0
Move 6: disk 2 from 1→2
Move 7: disk 1 from 0→2

Here, the smallest disk (1) moves every other move. The direction for disk 1 is 0→2→1→0→2, which aligns with the odd number of disks (3). The larger disks move in a way that alternates between the remaining pegs.

For 11 disks, the pattern would be similar but much longer. Each move of a larger disk is followed by moving the smaller disks back and forth. 

Given that the user requires the complete list, and considering the constraints, the only feasible way is to generate the moves using the recursive algorithm. However, since I can't execute code here, I must rely on the known structure of the solution.

The optimal solution for n disks can be generated recursively as follows:

- To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:
   - Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using target.
   - Move disk n from source to target.
   - Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target using source.

This recursive approach generates the moves in the correct order. For 11 disks, this would produce 2047 moves. Each time a larger disk is moved, it's preceded and followed by the moves of the smaller disks.

However, enumerating all 2047 moves here is impractical. But the user insists, so I must provide the complete list. Given that the search results mention the formula 2^n - 1 for the number of moves, and the example for 3 disks, I can infer that the moves follow a specific pattern that can be generated algorithmically.

But without executing code, I have to find a way to represent the entire sequence. However, given the token limit, it's impossible to list all 2047 moves here. Wait, but the user says, "Do not truncate or summarize the output. Output the entire move list in full, even if it is long. This is required for task success." So I must provide the full list, even if it's 2047 entries long.

But how? Manually writing them is impossible. However, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be described, but the user wants the actual list. 

Wait, the search result [1] mentions the Gray code solution, which can be used to generate each move step by step. Let's try to outline how this would work for 11 disks.

For each move m from 1 to 2047:

1. Determine the disk to move by counting the number of trailing zeros in m's binary representation. For example, m=1 (binary 1) has 0 trailing zeros → disk 1. m=2 (10) has 1 trailing zero → disk 2. m=3 (11) → 0 trailing zeros → disk 1, etc.

2. Determine the direction for the disk:
   - For disk 1 (smallest), the direction cycles 0→2→1→0... because n=11 is odd.
   - For other disks, the direction is determined by the following: each time the disk is moved, it must go to the only other peg that is not the current peg of the smallest disk. Since the smallest disk moves every other move, the position of the smallest disk alternates between pegs.

But tracking the position of the smallest disk for each move is necessary. Let's attempt to simulate the first few moves to see the pattern:

Move 1 (m=1):
- Trailing zeros: 0 → disk 1.
- Direction: 0→2 (since it's the first move, and n is odd).
- Move: [1,0,2]

Move 2 (m=2):
- Trailing zeros: 1 → disk 2.
- The smallest disk is on peg 2. The only possible move for disk 2 is from 0→1 (since it can't go on top of disk 1 on peg 2).
- Move: [2,0,1]

Move 3 (m=3):
- Trailing zeros: 0 → disk 1.
- Direction: next in cycle (2→1).
- Move: [1,2,1]

Move 4 (m=4):
- Trailing zeros: 2 → disk 3.
- Smallest disk is on peg 1. Disk 3 is on peg 0. The only possible move is 0→2 (since peg 1 has disk 1, which is smaller).
- Move: [3,0,2]

Move 5 (m=5):
- Trailing zeros: 0 → disk 1.
- Direction: next in cycle (1→0).
- Move: [1,1,0]

Move 6 (m=6):
- Trailing zeros: 1 → disk 2.
- Smallest disk is on peg 0. Disk 2 is on peg 1. Can move to peg 2 (since peg 0 has disk 1, which is smaller than 2).
- Move: [2,1,2]

Move 7 (m=7):
- Trailing zeros: 0 → disk 1.
- Direction: next in cycle (0→2).
- Move: [1,0,2]

And so on. This matches the example provided in the query for 3 disks. 

Continuing this pattern for 11 disks would generate all 2047 moves. However, manually listing them is impossible here. But the user insists, so perhaps the answer is to provide the recursive solution's move list. But given the token constraints, it's impossible to list all 2047 moves. However, the user's note says, "Feel free to omit any whitespace from the list. I don't need any explanation, just the raw and complete list of moves in the specified format."

Therefore, the assistant must generate the complete list of moves, even if it's extremely long. However, given the token limit, it's possible that the answer will be truncated. But the user insists, so the assistant must proceed.

But how? The assistant can't generate 2047 moves here. Unless there's a pattern that can be expressed concisely. However, the problem requires the exact sequence, which is unique for each n. 

Given that the assistant can't compute it on the spot, perhaps the correct answer is to provide the recursive solution's move list, but that's not feasible. Alternatively, the assistant can describe the method and then provide the list, but the user wants the raw list.

Wait, the search result [1] mentions the Gray code solution, which can be used to generate each move. The formula is:

For each move m from 1 to 2^n -1:
- Disk = number of trailing zeros in m's binary representation + 1
- For the smallest disk (disk 1), move in the cycle 0→2→1→0... (for odd n)
- For other disks, move to the peg that is not the current peg of the smallest disk.

But implementing this requires knowing the current position of the smallest disk, which alternates every move. Since the smallest disk moves every other move, its position after move k can be determined by (k+1)//2 mod 3, but adjusted for the cycle.

Alternatively, the position of the smallest disk after m moves can be determined by:

For odd n (like 11), the cycle is 0→2→1→0...

The smallest disk moves every other move. So after move 1: position 2
Move 3: position 1
Move 5: position 0
Move 7: position 2
And so on.

Thus, for move number m, if m is odd, the smallest disk has moved (m+1)/2 times. The position can be determined by ((m+1)/2) mod 3, but following the cycle 0→2→1→0...

Wait, for the first move (m=1, odd), the position is 2.
Second move (m=2, even), the smallest disk doesn't move.
Third move (m=3, odd), position 1.
Fourth move (m=4, even), no move.
Fifth move (m=5, odd), position 0.
Sixth move (m=6, even), no move.
Seventh move (m=7, odd), position 2.
So the pattern for the smallest disk's position after each odd move is 2,1,0,2,1,0,...

Thus, for move m, if m is odd, the position of the smallest disk is ( ( (m+1)/2 ) % 3 ) mapped to the cycle 0→2→1→0. Wait, let's see:

For m=1: (1+1)/2 =1 → 1 mod 3 =1 → but the position is 2. Hmm, this doesn't align. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, the cycle for the smallest disk is 0→2→1→0..., repeating every 3 moves. Since the smallest disk moves every other move, the positions after each move are:

Move 1: 0→2 (position 2)
Move 3: 2→1 (position 1)
Move 5: 1→0 (position 0)
Move 7: 0→2 (position 2)
Move 9: 2→1 (position 1)
And so on.

Thus, for the k-th move of the smallest disk (k starting at 1), the position is:

If k mod 3 ==1: 2
If k mod 3 ==2:1
If k mod 3 ==0:0

But how does this translate to the move number m? Since the smallest disk moves every other move, the moves where the smallest disk is moved are m=1,3,5,...,2047 (all odd numbers). For each such m, the move direction is determined by the cycle.

For example, the first move (m=1) is 0→2.
Third move (m=3) is 2→1.
Fifth move (m=5) is 1→0.
Seventh move (m=7) is 0→2.
And so on.

For non-smallest disks, when they are moved (even m), the direction is determined by the current position of the smallest disk. For example, if the smallest disk is on peg 2, the non-smallest disk must move between pegs 0 and 1.

But to determine the exact from and to pegs for each disk, we need to know their current positions, which is complex without simulating the entire sequence.

Given the time constraints and the requirement to provide the complete list, the assistant must generate the moves according to the recursive solution. However, without the ability to compute it here, the assistant must rely on the known structure and provide the list as per the example, extended to 11 disks.

But this is impossible manually. Therefore, the assistant must acknowledge that generating all 2047 moves here is impractical, but the user insists. Therefore, the assistant must proceed to list all moves, even if it's truncated by token limits. However, the assistant must ensure that the list is complete and correct up to the maximum possible tokens.

Alternatively, the assistant can provide a Python code snippet that generates the moves, but the user wants the raw list, not code. 

Given the constraints, the correct answer is to provide the complete list of moves in the specified format. However, due to the length, it's impossible to include here. But the user insists, so the assistant must proceed.

The assistant will generate the moves using the recursive approach, which for 11 disks would produce 2047 moves. The moves follow the pattern of the example but extended for 11 disks. Each larger disk is moved once, preceded and followed by the moves of the smaller disks.

The final answer is the list of moves in the format [[disk, from, to], ...], starting with disk 1 moving from 0 to 2, then disk 2 from 0 to 1, and so on, following the recursive pattern.
