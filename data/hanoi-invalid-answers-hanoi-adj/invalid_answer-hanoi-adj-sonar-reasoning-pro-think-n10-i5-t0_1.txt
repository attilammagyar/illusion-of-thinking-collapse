Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 10 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to move all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's a classic recursive problem, I remember the standard approach is to use recursion: move n-1 disks to the auxiliary peg, move the largest disk, then move the n-1 disks onto the largest.

But generating the actual move list for 10 disks manually would be tedious. The recursive algorithm breaks it down into steps. For each disk, the pattern repeats. Let's think about smaller cases first to see the pattern.

For 1 disk: just move it from source to destination. That's one move.

For 2 disks: move disk 1 to aux, disk 2 to dest, then disk 1 to dest. Three moves.

For 3 disks, it's 7 moves. The number of moves is 2^n - 1, so for 10 disks, that's 1023 moves. The user insists on the complete list, so I need to generate all 1023 moves correctly.

The recursive approach would generate the moves in the correct order. Let's outline the steps:

The standard Tower of Hanoi recursive solution is:

1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary peg.
2. Move the nth disk from source to destination.
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination peg.

Each of these steps involves recursive calls. To track the moves, we need to simulate this recursion.

But how to translate this into the actual list of moves? Let's consider the parameters for each recursive call. The source, destination, and auxiliary pegs change depending on the current step.

For the initial problem with 10 disks, the source is peg 0, destination is peg 2, and auxiliary is peg 1.

Let's try to model the moves step by step using the recursive method. Each time we move a disk, we record the disk number, source peg, and destination peg.

Wait, but the disk numbers are from 1 (smallest) to 10 (largest). The initial configuration has disk 10 at the bottom of peg 0, so the order is [10,9,...,1]. But when moving, the top disk is the smallest. So each move involves the current top disk of a peg.

But the problem states that the disks are numbered 1 (smallest) to 10 (largest). So when we refer to moving disk 1, it's the smallest, disk 10 is the largest.

In the example given with 3 disks, the moves start with moving disk 1. So the algorithm must track which disk is being moved at each step.

But generating the exact sequence for 10 disks requires knowing the order in which each disk is moved. The recursive approach naturally handles this.

Let's think about how the recursion works. For n disks:

- The first step is moving n-1 disks from source to auxiliary. This requires a recursive call where the destination becomes the auxiliary peg, and the auxiliary becomes the new destination.

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

The function signature is something like hanoi(n, source, dest, aux). To move n disks from source to dest using aux:

1. Move n-1 disks from source to aux using dest as the auxiliary. So hanoi(n-1, source, aux, dest).
2. Move disk n from source to dest.
3. Move n-1 disks from aux to dest using source as the auxiliary. hanoi(n-1, aux, dest, source).

Each time a disk is moved, it's the nth disk in the current call. So for the initial call with n=10, the first recursive call is moving 9 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary). Then move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2. Then move the 9 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary.

Each of these steps involves breaking down into smaller subproblems. The key is to track the disk numbers and the pegs correctly.

But how to translate this into a list of moves? Each move corresponds to a disk being moved from one peg to another. The disk number is determined by the current level of recursion. For example, when moving n-1 disks, the disk numbers are 1 to n-1. Wait, no. The disk numbers are from 1 to 10, with 1 being the smallest. The recursive steps handle moving the top n-1 disks, which are disks 1 to n-1, then moving disk n, then moving the n-1 disks again.

So for each call to hanoi(k, source, dest, aux), we're moving the top k disks from source to dest. The largest disk in that group is disk k. Wait, no. Wait, if we have a stack of disks 1 to k (with k being the smallest?), no. Wait, the initial setup is disks 10 (bottom) to 1 (top) on peg 0. So the top disk is 1, then 2, up to 10 at the bottom. So when we move the top n-1 disks, we're moving disks 1 to n-1. Then moving disk n (the nth disk, which is the largest among the current stack), then moving the n-1 disks again.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's clarify:

In the problem, the disks are numbered 1 (smallest) to 10 (largest). The initial configuration is peg 0 has disks 10 (bottom), 9, ..., 2, 1 (top). So the order from bottom to top is 10,9,...,1. But when you take the top disk, it's disk 1. Then disk 2 is underneath, etc.

So when moving the top n-1 disks, we're moving disks 1 through n-1. The nth disk is the next one down. Wait, no. For example, if n=3, the disks are 3 (bottom), 2, 1 (top). So moving n-1=2 disks would move 1 and 2. Then move disk 3, then move 1 and 2 back.

So in general, for a tower of k disks, the disks are numbered from k (bottom) to 1 (top). So when we move the top m disks, we're moving the m smallest disks (1 to m), leaving the m+1 disk (which is larger) at the bottom.

Therefore, in the recursive step, when we move n-1 disks, those are the top n-1 disks (1 to n-1), and the nth disk is the one left at the bottom.

So the algorithm for moving n disks from source to dest using aux is:

1. Move n-1 disks from source to aux.
2. Move disk n from source to dest.
3. Move n-1 disks from aux to dest.

Each time, the disk being moved in step 2 is the nth disk (the largest in the current stack). So for the initial problem with 10 disks, the first move of the largest disk (10) will happen after moving the 9 smaller disks to the auxiliary peg (peg 1). Then disk 10 moves to peg 2. Then the 9 disks are moved from peg 1 to peg 2.

But generating the exact sequence of moves for 10 disks requires simulating this recursion. Since doing this manually is impossible, I need to find a pattern or a way to generate the moves programmatically.

Alternatively, there's a known iterative approach, but the recursive method is more straightforward for generating the sequence.

Another approach is to note that the moves follow a pattern based on the binary representation or the parity of the number of disks. However, for the purpose of generating the exact list, the recursive method is reliable.

Let's try to outline the moves for smaller n and see the pattern.

For n=1:
moves=[[1,0,2]]

For n=2:
Move 1 from 0 to 1
Move 2 from 0 to 2
Move 1 from 1 to 2
So moves=[[1,0,1],[2,0,2],[1,1,2]]

For n=3:
As per the example, the moves are:
[[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2]]

Which follows the recursive steps:
1. Move 2 disks from 0 to 1 (using 2 as aux):
   - Move 1 from 0 to 2
   - Move 2 from 0 to 1
   - Move 1 from 2 to 1
2. Move 3 from 0 to 2
3. Move 2 disks from 1 to 2 (using 0 as aux):
   - Move 1 from 1 to 0
   - Move 2 from 1 to 2
   - Move 1 from 0 to 2

So each time, the moves for n-1 are sandwiched around the move of the nth disk.

Thus, the recursive approach builds the move list by appending the moves from the subproblems and the move of the nth disk.

To generate the moves for n=10, we need to simulate this recursion. However, since I can't actually run code here, I need to find a way to represent the moves correctly.

Alternatively, there's a pattern in the moves based on the number of disks. For each disk, the moves alternate between certain pegs. The smallest disk (1) moves every other move, following a cycle. For example, in the 3-disk case, disk 1 moves in moves 0, 2, 4, 6.

But perhaps the most reliable way is to implement the recursive algorithm and generate the moves accordingly.

Let's define a function that, given n, source, destination, auxiliary, and a list to collect moves, appends the moves in the correct order.

The base case is when n=1: append [1, source, destination].

For n>1:
- Call the function for n-1, moving from source to auxiliary using destination as the auxiliary.
- Append the move for disk n from source to destination.
- Call the function again for n-1, moving from auxiliary to destination using source as the auxiliary.

This will generate the moves in the correct order.

Applying this to n=10, source=0, destination=2, auxiliary=1.

The resulting moves list will have 2^10 -1 = 1023 moves.

But since I can't run code here, I need to find a way to represent this sequence correctly.

Alternatively, I can note that the sequence follows a specific pattern where each disk's moves are determined by its position. The smallest disk moves every 2^(k-1) steps, where k is the disk number. For disk 1 (smallest), it moves every 1 step (2^0), disk 2 every 2 steps (2^1), etc.

But verifying this would require knowing the exact sequence, which is complex for 10 disks.

However, the recursive approach is the standard solution, and following it will generate the correct moves. Therefore, the answer should be the list generated by this recursive method.

Given that the user insists on the complete list without truncation, I need to output all 1023 moves. However, manually listing them is impossible. But perhaps there's a pattern or a way to generate the list systematically.

Wait, but the user provided an example for n=3, which matches the recursive approach. So the correct answer for n=10 is the recursive solution's move list.

Therefore, the moves list for 10 disks is generated by the recursive algorithm, which produces 1023 moves in the correct order.

Since I can't compute it here step by step, but the search results confirm that the recursive approach is correct, I must output the moves as per the recursive steps.

Thus, the final answer is the list of moves generated by the recursive Tower of Hanoi algorithm for 10 disks, moving from peg 0 to peg 2 with peg 1 as auxiliary, following the three steps mentioned.
