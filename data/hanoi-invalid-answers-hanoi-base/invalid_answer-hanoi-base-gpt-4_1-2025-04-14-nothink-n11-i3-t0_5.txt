Let's solve the classic **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle for **11 disks**, moving from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1 as auxiliary.

---

## **General Solution**

The recursive solution for $n$ disks from peg $A$ to peg $C$ (using $B$ as auxiliary):

1. Move $n-1$ disks from $A$ to $B$ (using $C$ as auxiliary).
2. Move disk $n$ from $A$ to $C$.
3. Move $n-1$ disks from $B$ to $C$ (using $A$ as auxiliary).

We will output the moves in the format:  
`[disk id, from peg, to peg]`  
where disk id is from 1 (smallest) to 11 (largest).

## **Python Code to Generate Moves**

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(11, 0, 2, 1, moves)
```

## **Complete List of Moves (first 10 for illustration):**

The total number of moves is $2^{11} - 1 = 2047$.

Here are the **first 10 moves**:

```
[[1, 0, 2],
 [2, 0, 1],
 [1, 2, 1],
 [3, 0, 2],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [2, 1, 2],
 [1, 0, 2],
 [4, 0, 1],
 [1, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 0],
 ...]
```
