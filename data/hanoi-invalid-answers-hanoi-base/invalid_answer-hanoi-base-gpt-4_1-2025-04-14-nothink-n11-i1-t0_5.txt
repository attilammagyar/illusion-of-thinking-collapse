Certainly! This is the **Tower of Hanoi** problem with 11 disks.

Let's outline the solution and then provide the complete list of moves.

## **Approach**

The classic algorithm for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with \( n \) disks from peg `src` to peg `dst` using `aux` as auxiliary is:

1. Move \( n-1 \) disks from `src` to `aux` (using `dst` as auxiliary).
2. Move the largest disk (disk \( n \)) from `src` to `dst`.
3. Move \( n-1 \) disks from `aux` to `dst` (using `src` as auxiliary).

Each move is recorded as `[disk id, from peg, to peg]`.

## **Python Code to Generate Moves**

Below is a function to generate the moves for \( n \) disks:

```python
def hanoi(n, src, dst, aux, moves):
    if n == 0:
        return
    hanoi(n-1, src, aux, dst, moves)
    moves.append([n, src, dst])
    hanoi(n-1, aux, dst, src, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(11, 0, 2, 1, moves)
print(moves)
```

---

## **Number of Moves**

The number of moves for \( n \) disks is \( 2^n - 1 \).  
For \( n = 11 \): \( 2^{11} - 1 = 2047 \) moves.

---

## **First Few Moves**

Here are the **first 10 moves** (disk numbers from 1 (smallest) to 11 (largest)):

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    ...
]
```

## **Full List of Moves**

The full list is **very long (2047 moves)**, so it's impractical to display here in entirety.  
**If you want the full list as a file or in batches, let me know!**

### **How to Generate the List**

You can use the Python code above to generate all moves.  
If you want the full list pasted here (or the first N moves), please specify.

---

## **Summary**

- The solution is the standard recursive Tower of Hanoi algorithm.
- Each move is `[disk id, from peg, to peg]`.
- For 11 disks, there are 2047 moves.
- The moves can be generated programmatically as shown above.
