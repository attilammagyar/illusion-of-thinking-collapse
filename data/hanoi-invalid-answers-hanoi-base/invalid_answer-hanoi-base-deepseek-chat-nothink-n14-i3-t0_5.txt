### Understanding the Problem

The puzzle described is the classic **Tower of Hanoi** problem, which involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another under specific constraints. Here's a recap of the rules:

1. **Only one disk can be moved at a time**: This means we can't move multiple disks simultaneously.
2. **Move the top disk**: We can only take the topmost disk from any peg and place it onto another peg.
3. **No larger disk on a smaller one**: At no point can a disk be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Given that we have 14 disks initially on Peg 0, and we need to move them all to Peg 2, with Peg 1 serving as an auxiliary peg.

### General Strategy for Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi problem has a well-known recursive solution. The strategy for moving `n` disks from a source peg to a target peg using an auxiliary peg is as follows:

1. **Move `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg**: This uses the target peg as a temporary holding space.
2. **Move the nth disk (the largest one) from the source peg to the target peg**: This is a straightforward move since the largest disk can always be placed on an empty peg or on a peg where all disks are larger than it (but in this step, the target peg is empty).
3. **Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg**: Now, these disks are placed on top of the largest disk on the target peg.

This approach reduces the problem of moving `n` disks to moving `n-1` disks, which is the essence of recursion.

### Applying the Strategy to 14 Disks

For `n = 14`, the sequence of moves would be:

1. Move the top 13 disks from Peg 0 to Peg 1 (using Peg 2 as auxiliary).
2. Move disk 14 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
3. Move the 13 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (using Peg 0 as auxiliary).

Each of these steps involving 13 disks can be further broken down recursively until we reach the base case of moving a single disk.

### Generating the Move Sequence

Given the recursive nature of the solution, the total number of moves required is `2^n - 1`. For 14 disks, that's `2^14 - 1 = 16383` moves. Enumerating all these moves manually is impractical, but we can describe the sequence's generation algorithmically.

Here's how the moves would be generated programmatically (though we'll outline the approach rather than list all 16383 moves):

1. **Define a recursive function** `hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary)`:
   - If `n == 1`, move the disk from `source` to `target`.
   - Else:
     - Call `hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)`.
     - Move disk `n` from `source` to `target`.
     - Call `hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)`.

2. **Initial Call**: `hanoi(14, 0, 2, 1)`.

### Example of Small Case

To illustrate, let's see the moves for `n = 3` (as given in the original example):

Initial state: [[3, 2, 1], [], []]

Moves:
1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [[3, 2], [], [1]]
2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1: [[3], [2], [1]]
3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1: [[3], [2, 1], []]
4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2: [[], [2, 1], [3]]
5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0: [[1], [2], [3]]
6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2: [[1], [], [3, 2]]
7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [[], [], [3, 2, 1]]

This matches the provided example.

### Final Answer for 14 Disks

Given the impracticality of listing all 16383 moves here, the complete sequence can be generated by implementing the recursive algorithm described above. However, the first few and last few moves would look like this (starting with moving the top 13 disks to Peg 1, then disk 14 to Peg 2, then the 13 disks to Peg 2):

**Initial Moves (moving 13 disks from Peg 0 to Peg 1):**
1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2
   ...
   (Continuing until all 13 disks are on Peg 1)

**Middle Move:**
- Move disk 14 from 0 to 2

**Final Moves (moving 13 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2):**
   ...
   (Reverse of the initial moves, adjusting pegs accordingly)
   - Move disk 1 from 1 to 0
   - Move disk 2 from 1 to 2
   - Move disk 1 from 0 to 2
   - Move disk 3 from 1 to 0
   - Move disk 1 from 2 to 1
   - Move disk 2 from 2 to 0
   - Move disk 1 from 1 to 0
   ...
   (Continuing until all disks are on Peg 2)

### Complete Move Sequence Generation

For the complete sequence, here's a Python-like pseudocode that would generate all moves:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, target]]
    else:
        moves = []
        moves += hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        moves += [[n, source, target]]
        moves += hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)
        return moves

moves = hanoi(14, 0, 2, 1)
```

Executing this would give the full list of 16383 moves in the correct order.

### Final Answer

Given the size, here's the representation of the complete move sequence algorithmically:

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [5, 0, 2],
    ...
    [14, 0, 2],
    ...
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2]
]
```

(Note: The actual complete sequence would contain 16383 moves following this pattern.)

### Conclusion

The sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi with 14 disks is generated by recursively moving smaller stacks to free up the larger disks, then placing the largest disk, and then moving the smaller stacks onto the largest disk. The total number of moves is 16,383, following the recursive algorithm outlined. For practical purposes, implementing the recursive function in code is the most efficient way to generate the entire sequence.
