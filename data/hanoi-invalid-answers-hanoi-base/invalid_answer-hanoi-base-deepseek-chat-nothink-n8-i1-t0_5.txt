Alright, let's tackle the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 8 disks. I'll approach this step by step, making sure to follow the rules and keep track of each move.

### Understanding the Problem
We have three pegs: Peg 0, Peg 1, and Peg 2. Initially, all 8 disks are on Peg 0, stacked from largest (disk 8 at the bottom) to smallest (disk 1 at the top). The goal is to move all disks to Peg 2, following the rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Only the top disk of a stack can be moved.
3. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one.

### Strategy
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive problem. The general strategy for moving `n` disks from a source peg to a target peg using an auxiliary peg is:
1. Move `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.
2. Move the `n-th` disk (the largest one) from the source peg to the target peg.
3. Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.

For our case, `n = 8`, source is Peg 0, target is Peg 2, and auxiliary is Peg 1.

### Step-by-Step Moves
Let's start moving the disks. I'll keep track of each move in the format `[disk, from peg, to peg]`.

#### Move 1-7: Moving disks 1-7 from Peg 0 to Peg 1 (using Peg 2 as auxiliary)
This is equivalent to solving the problem for 7 disks from Peg 0 to Peg 1.

1. Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2: `[1, 0, 2]`
2. Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1: `[2, 0, 1]`
3. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1: `[1, 2, 1]`
4. Move disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2: `[3, 0, 2]`
