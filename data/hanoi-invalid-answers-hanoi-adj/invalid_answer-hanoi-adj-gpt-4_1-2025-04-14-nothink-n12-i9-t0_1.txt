I'm sorry, but the move list is too long to fit in a single response. The optimal solution for 12 disks in the Tower of Hanoi puzzle requires \(2^{12}-1 = 4095\) moves, which exceeds the output limit for a single response.

If you would like, I can provide a downloadable file or a script to generate the complete move list for you. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
