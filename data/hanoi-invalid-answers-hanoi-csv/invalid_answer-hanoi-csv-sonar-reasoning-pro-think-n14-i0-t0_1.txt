Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 14 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves in CSV format without any explanation. First, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive problem. The minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, so for 14 disks, that's 2^14 - 1 = 16383 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

The challenge here is generating all 16383 moves correctly. Since doing this manually isn't feasible, I need to find an algorithm that can generate the moves step by step. From the search results, there's mention of an iterative solution. The iterative approach alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only legal move with a non-smallest disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern—maybe to the right each time.

Looking at the example provided in the search results for 3 disks, the moves follow a certain pattern. The recursive approach usually breaks the problem into moving n-1 disks, then the nth disk, then the n-1 disks again. But implementing that recursively might not be feasible here due to stack depth, but since we need an iterative solution, let's think about the iterative method.

The iterative solution for even n (14 is even) involves moving the smallest disk in a consistent direction (to the right, since the number is even) and then making the only possible move with the other disks. Each move alternates between the smallest and the next possible disk.

So, the steps would be:

1. Initialize the pegs. All disks start on peg 0.
2. Determine the direction for the smallest disk (even n means moving to the right, so peg 0 → 1 → 2 → 0...).
3. While the puzzle isn't solved:
   a. Move the smallest disk in the current direction.
   b. Make the only legal move possible with the remaining disks (which doesn't involve the smallest disk).
   c. Repeat until all disks are on peg 2.

But how to translate this into a sequence of moves? Let's think about the pattern for smaller numbers. For 1 disk, it's simple: move from 0 to 2. For 2 disks: move 1 to 1, 2 to 2, then 1 to 2. For 3 disks, the example given in the query has 7 moves. The pattern alternates between moving the smallest and the next disk.

Since 14 is even, the iterative solution's direction for the smallest disk is to the right each time. So each move of the smallest disk cycles through pegs 0→1→2→0, etc. After each move of the smallest disk, there's a move of the next available disk, which can only be between the two non-smallest pegs.

But generating all these moves programmatically would require tracking the state of each peg and the direction. However, since I can't write code here, I need to find a pattern or formula that can generate each move step by step.

Another approach is to note that each disk's moves follow a specific pattern. For example, disk 1 (smallest) moves every other move. The number of times each disk moves is 2^(14 - k) for disk k. But how to determine the from and to pegs for each move?

Alternatively, using the binary representation of the move number. Each move corresponds to a bit in binary, and the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move count. But this might be complex.

Wait, the search result [2] mentions the iterative solution: alternate moves between the smallest and a non-smallest piece. For even n, the smallest moves to the right. The non-smallest move is the only legal one. So the algorithm would be:

- Initialize direction for smallest disk (right for even n).
- While not solved:
   - Move smallest disk in current direction.
   - Make the only legal move possible with the remaining disks (not involving the smallest).
   - Repeat.

So, for each step, after moving the smallest, there's exactly one legal move between the other two pegs. That move is determined by which of the two pegs (not the one where the smallest is) has a smaller top disk.

But tracking the state of all pegs for 14 disks is complicated. However, since the user needs the full list, perhaps there's a pattern in the moves that can be generated without simulating each step.

Alternatively, using the recursive approach but converting it into an iterative list. The recursive solution for moving n disks from A to C using B as auxiliary is:

1. Move n-1 disks from A to B using C.
2. Move disk n from A to C.
3. Move n-1 disks from B to C using A.

Each of these steps can be expanded recursively. For 14 disks, this would generate a sequence of moves. However, converting this recursion into an iterative list would require a stack-based approach, keeping track of the current task (move n disks from X to Y via Z).

But again, generating this manually isn't feasible. However, the user insists on the complete list, so perhaps the answer is to output the recursive solution's moves, which can be generated algorithmically.

But given the constraints of this task, I need to find a way to represent the moves correctly. Since the example for 3 disks is provided, perhaps the pattern can be extended. For each disk, the moves alternate between pegs based on whether the disk number is even or odd.

Wait, another approach from the search results: the iterative solution for even n starts by moving the smallest disk to the right (peg 1), then the next move is between the other pegs. Let's try to outline the first few moves for 14 disks.

Move 1: Disk 1 from 0 to 1 (smallest move right)
Move 2: The only legal move not involving disk 1 is between peg 0 and 2. Since peg 0 has disk 2, and peg 2 is empty, move disk 2 from 0 to 2.
Move 3: Move disk 1 from 1 to 2.
Move 4: Move disk 3 from 0 to 1.
Move 5: Move disk 1 from 2 to 0.
Move 6: Move disk 2 from 2 to 1.
Move 7: Move disk 1 from 0 to 1.
Move 8: Move disk 4 from 0 to 2.
... and so on.

This pattern continues, with the smallest disk moving right each time (0→1→2→0...), and the non-smallest moves alternating between the other pegs based on the top disks.

But generating all 16383 moves manually is impossible. However, the user expects the complete list. Since the problem is a benchmark test, perhaps the solution is to output the standard Tower of Hanoi sequence generated by the recursive algorithm, which is known to be optimal.

The recursive approach for moving n disks from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1 as auxiliary would generate the correct sequence. Each move can be determined by the recursive steps.

But how to represent this without actual code? The key is that each disk's movement follows a specific pattern. For example, disk 1 moves every other move, disk 2 every four moves, etc. The direction depends on the disk's position in the recursion.

Alternatively, the parity of the disk number determines the direction. For even-numbered disks, the direction is different from odd. But I'm not sure.

Wait, in the example for 3 disks (odd), the moves start by moving disk 1 to peg 2. For even n, the first move is to peg 1. So the direction alternates based on the number of disks.

Given that 14 is even, the first move is disk 1 to peg 1. Then the next move is disk 2 to peg 2. Then disk 1 to peg 2, and so on.

But to generate all moves, I need a systematic way. Since I can't write code here, perhaps the answer is to provide the standard recursive solution's move list, which for 14 disks would be a sequence of 16383 moves, each following the recursive pattern.

However, the problem is that the assistant can't generate 16k lines here due to token limits. But the user insists, so perhaps the answer must be the CSV list starting with the first few moves and ending with the last, but that's impossible. Wait, the user says "output the entire move list in full, even if it is long. This is required for task success." But given the context, maybe the assistant is expected to provide the correct algorithm and the first few moves, but that's not what the user wants.

Wait, the search result [3] is a video showing the solution for 14 disks. Maybe the moves are generated there, but the transcript isn't helpful. The other results mention the iterative approach but don't provide the full move list.

Alternatively, the assistant can generate the moves using the recursive approach, but since it's 14 disks, the move list is too long. However, the user insists, so perhaps the assistant must output the entire list, even if it's truncated by the system. But the assistant's response must attempt to generate all moves.

But given the token constraints, it's impossible to output 16k lines. However, the assistant might proceed to generate the CSV header and the first few moves, then continue until the token limit is reached. But the user specifically says not to truncate. This is a dilemma.

Wait, the user's note says: "This is a benchmark test where the first invalid move you generate matters. The more valid and parsable moves you generate from the optimal solution, the better your score will be. Truncating the list in any way risks a low score. Therefore your best strategy is to attempt to output the complete list, even if you risk running out of output tokens."

So the assistant must try to generate as many correct moves as possible, even if it can't finish. But how?

The optimal solution for Tower of Hanoi is well-known, and the moves can be generated algorithmically. The recursive function is:

def hanoi(n, from_peg, to_peg, aux_peg):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"1,{from_peg},{to_peg}")
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, from_peg, aux_peg, to_peg)
        print(f"{n},{from_peg},{to_peg}")
        hanoi(n-1, aux_peg, to_peg, from_peg)

For n=14, this would generate the correct sequence. However, implementing this recursively in the assistant's mind isn't feasible, but perhaps the assistant can outline the first few moves and then indicate the pattern, but the user wants the full list.

Alternatively, the assistant can generate the list programmatically here. But without executing code, it's impossible. However, the assistant might have internal knowledge of the Tower of Hanoi sequence and can output it.

Wait, the assistant's knowledge cutoff is October 2023, and it can access search results. The search results here include the iterative solution, which can be used to generate the moves step by step.

The iterative algorithm for Tower of Hanoi is as follows:

1. Calculate the total number of moves: 2^n - 1.
2. For even n:
   - The smallest disk moves in the order: 0 → 1 → 2 → 0 → 1 → 2...
3. For each move:
   a. If the move number is odd, move the smallest disk in the current direction.
   b. If the move number is even, make the only legal move possible between the two non-smallest pegs.

So, for 14 disks (even), the smallest disk (1) moves right each time: 0→1→2→0...

The non-smallest moves are determined by the top disks on the other two pegs. For example, after moving disk 1 to peg 1, the next move is between peg 0 and 2. The top disks are 2 on peg 0 and nothing on peg 2, so move disk 2 to peg 2.

Next, move disk 1 to peg 2. Then, the next non-smallest move is between peg 0 and 1. The top disks are 3 on peg 0 and nothing on peg 1, so move disk 3 to peg 1. And so on.

This pattern continues, with the smallest disk moving right each time, and the non-smallest move being the only legal one between the other two pegs.

To generate the entire list, the assistant would need to simulate each move, keeping track of the state of each peg. However, without actual code, this is challenging. But perhaps the assistant can generate the first few moves correctly, following this pattern, and then continue the pattern, but given the length, it's impractical.

But the user insists, so the assistant must try. Let's start generating the moves step by step.

Move 1: Disk 1 from 0 to 1 (smallest move right)
Move 2: Disk 2 from 0 to 2 (only legal move between 0 and 2)
Move 3: Disk 1 from 1 to 2 (smallest move right)
Move 4: Disk 3 from 0 to 1 (only legal move between 0 and 1)
Move 5: Disk 1 from 2 to 0 (smallest move right, wraps around)
Move 6: Disk 2 from 2 to 1 (move between 2 and 1, since disk 2 can go on peg 1 (empty))
Move 7: Disk 1 from 0 to 1 (smallest move right)
Move 8: Disk 4 from 0 to 2 (only legal move between 0 and 2)
Move 9: Disk 1 from 1 to 2
Move 10: Disk 2 from 1 to 0
Move 11: Disk 1 from 2 to 0
Move 12: Disk 3 from 1 to 2
Move 13: Disk 1 from 0 to 1
Move 14: Disk 2 from 0 to 2
Move 15: Disk 1 from 1 to 2
Move 16: Disk 5 from 0 to 1
...

This pattern continues, with each even move involving a non-smallest disk. However, manually listing 16383 moves is impossible here. The assistant must find a way to represent the entire sequence correctly.

But given the constraints, perhaps the correct answer is to output the CSV header followed by all 16383 moves generated by the recursive algorithm. Since the assistant can't actually compute them, but knows the structure, maybe it's possible to describe the pattern, but the user wants the raw list.

Alternatively, the assistant can provide a Python script that generates the moves, but the user wants the moves themselves, not the code.

Given the user's insistence and the benchmark nature, the assistant must output the complete list. However, due to token limitations, it's impossible. Therefore, the assistant must proceed to generate as much as possible, following the iterative approach, and hope that the system allows it.

But considering the example for 3 disks has 7 moves, and the pattern is known, perhaps the assistant can generate the list programmatically in text. However, without actual code execution, this is challenging.

Alternatively, the assistant can use the recursive approach's logic to list the moves. For 14 disks, the first move is to move 13 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, then move disk 14 to peg 2, then move 13 disks from peg 1 to peg 2. Each of these steps involves recursive moves.

But again, without code, it's impossible to list all moves. Therefore, the assistant must acknowledge the impossibility but proceed as much as possible.

Wait, the user's query is a test, and the assistant's score depends on generating as many correct moves as possible. Therefore, the assistant should output the CSV header and start listing the moves following the iterative approach, continuing until the token limit is reached.

So, the answer would start with:

disk_id,from_peg,to_peg
1,0,1
2,0,2
1,1,2
3,0,1
1,2,0
2,2,1
1,0,1
4,0,2
1,1,2
2,1,0
1,2,0
3,1,2
1,0,1
2,0,2
1,1,2
5,0,1
...

And continue this pattern. However, without actual computation, the assistant can't generate all 16k moves correctly. But perhaps the assistant can describe the pattern and let the user know that the full list follows this pattern, but the user explicitly wants the raw list.

Given the constraints, the assistant must proceed to generate the moves step by step as per the iterative algorithm, knowing that it can't complete the entire list but will provide as much as possible within the token limit.

Therefore, the final answer is the CSV list starting with the header and the first few moves, following the iterative approach for even n, and continuing until the token limit is reached. However, since the assistant can't actually compute all moves here, it's a partial answer. But according to the user's note, even a partial answer is better than none, as long as the initial moves are correct.
