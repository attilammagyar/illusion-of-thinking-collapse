Let's solve the classic **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle for **9 disks**.

### **Strategy**

The recursive algorithm for Tower of Hanoi with \( n \) disks is:

1. Move \( n-1 \) disks from source (peg 0) to auxiliary (peg 1), using destination (peg 2) as auxiliary.
2. Move the largest disk (\( n \)) from source (peg 0) to destination (peg 2).
3. Move \( n-1 \) disks from auxiliary (peg 1) to destination (peg 2), using source (peg 0) as auxiliary.

### **Move Format**

Each move is: `[disk id, from peg, to peg]` (disk id: 1=smallest, 9=largest).

## **Python Code to Generate Moves**

```python
moves = []

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 0:
        return
    hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
    moves.append([n, source, target])
    hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

hanoi(9, 0, 2, 1)
```

---

## **Complete List of Moves**

The number of moves is \( 2^9 - 1 = 511 \).

Below are the **first 10 and last 10 moves** (full list is very long, let me know if you want the entire list!):

### **First 10 moves**

```
[[1, 0, 2],
 [2, 0, 1],
 [1, 2, 1],
 [3, 0, 2],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [2, 1, 2],
 [1, 0, 2],
 [4, 0, 1],
 [1, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 0]]
```

### **Last 10 moves**

```
[[2, 1, 2],
 [1, 0, 2],
 [9, 0, 2],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [2, 1, 2],
 [1, 0, 2],
 [3, 1, 0],
 [1, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 0],
 [1, 1, 0]]
```

## **Full Move List**

If you want the **entire list of 511 moves**, let me know and I can provide it as a downloadable file or paste it in parts.

---

## **Summary**

- **Initial configuration**: `[[9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], [], []]`
- **Goal configuration**: `[[], [], [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]]`
- **Moves**: 511 total, each as `[disk id, from peg, to peg]` in the order to be performed.

Would you like the **full move list**? Or just a summary/code to generate it?
