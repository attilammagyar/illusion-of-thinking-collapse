This is the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 7 disks. I'll solve it step by step, creating the complete sequence of moves.

First, let's understand the format required for the output:
```
move_id,from_peg,to_peg,peg0,peg1,peg2
```

For the initial configuration:
- Peg 0: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 (from bottom to top)
- Peg 1: (empty)
- Peg 2: (empty)

The goal is to move all disks to Peg 2 while following the rules.

For the Tower of Hanoi with n disks, the optimal solution requires 2^n - 1 moves. With 7 disks, we need 2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127 moves.

The general recursive strategy for Tower of Hanoi is:
1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary peg
2. Move the largest disk from source to target peg
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target peg

Let me work through the solution systematically for 7 disks:

Initial state: [7 6 5 4 3 2 1], [], []

Let's implement the recursive solution:

```
def solve_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, target, moves_list, current_state):
    if n == 1:
        # Move disk 1 from source to target
        move_disk(source, target, moves_list, current_state)
    else:
        # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
        solve_hanoi(n-1, source, target, auxiliary, moves_list, current_state)
        # Move disk n from source to target
        move_disk(source, target, moves_list, current_state)
        # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target
        solve_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, target, moves_list, current_state)

def move_disk(source, target, moves_list, current_state):
    # Move the top disk from source to target
    disk = current_state[source].pop()
    current_state[target].append(disk)
    moves_list.append((source, target, current_state.copy()))
```

I'll now manually trace through this algorithm to generate all 127 moves:

Initial state: 
- Peg 0: [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
- Peg 1: []
- Peg 2: []

But rather than tracing through the recursive algorithm step by step, let me use a well-known pattern for the Tower of Hanoi:

For an odd number of disks (we have 7 which is odd):
1. The first move is always from the source peg to the target peg (Peg 0 to Peg 2)
2. After that, always make the only legal move that doesn't repeat the most recent move

For an even number of disks:
1. The first move is always from the source peg to the auxiliary peg (Peg 0 to Peg 1)
2. After that, always make the only legal move that doesn't repeat the most recent move

Let me start generating the moves for our 7-disk problem:

Initial state: 
- Peg 0: [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
- Peg 1: []
- Peg 2: []

Actually, I think I need to be more methodical to avoid errors. Let me trace the recursive algorithm manually:

For 7 disks:
1. Move 6 disks from Peg 0 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary
2. Move disk 7 from Peg 0 to Peg 2
3. Move 6 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 0 as auxiliary

For "Move 6 disks from Peg 0 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary":
1. Move 5 disks from Peg 0 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary
2. Move disk 6 from Peg 0 to Peg 1
3. Move 5 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 0 as auxiliary

And so on...

This becomes quite complex to trace manually. Instead, let me directly follow the algorithm for odd number of disks:

1. The first move is from Peg 0 to Peg 2 (disk 1)
2. Then always make the only legal move that doesn't repeat the previous move

I'll now generate the full sequence of 127 moves:

Let's start:

Initial state:
- Peg 0: [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
- Peg 1: []
- Peg 2: []

Actually, let me try a different approach. I'll use the recursive algorithm and trace it systematically for all 7 disks. Let's break this down:

           3. Move 3 disks from Peg 0 to Peg 2 using Peg 1
              A. Move 2 disks from Peg 0 to Peg 1 using Peg 2
                 - Move 1 disk from Peg 0 to Peg 2: Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2
                 - Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1: Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1
                 - Move 1 disk from Peg 2 to Peg 1: Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1
              B. Move disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2: Move disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2
              C. Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 0
                 - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 0: Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 0
                 - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2: Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2
                 - Move 1 disk from Peg 0 to Peg 2: Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2

This is getting quite cumbersome to trace manually. Let me implement a simpler approach.

For a Tower of Hanoi with 7 disks, there is a pattern we can follow:

1. For disks numbered with odd values (1, 3, 5, 7):
   - Always move them in the same direction (for 7 disks, that's clockwise: 0->2->1->0)

2. For disks numbered with even values (2, 4, 6):
   - Always move them in the opposite direction (for 7 disks, that's counterclockwise: 0->1->2->0)

Let me implement this approach to generate all 127 moves:

Initial configuration:
- Peg 0: [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
- Peg 1: []
- Peg 2: []

Let's track the positions of each disk:
- Disk 1: Peg 0
- Disk 2: Peg 0
- Disk 3: Peg 0
- Disk 4: Peg 0
- Disk 5: Peg 0
- Disk 6: Peg 0
- Disk 7: Peg 0

Now, let's start making moves:
