Alright, let's tackle the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 5 disks. I'll approach this step by step, making sure to follow the rules and keep track of each move.

### Understanding the Problem
We have three pegs: Peg 0, Peg 1, and Peg 2. Initially, all disks are on Peg 0, stacked from largest (disk 5 at the bottom) to smallest (disk 1 at the top). The goal is to move all disks to Peg 2, following the rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Only the top disk of a stack can be moved.
3. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

### Strategy
The standard approach to solving the Tower of Hanoi is recursive:
1. Move the top \( n-1 \) disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg (not the target peg).
2. Move the largest disk (disk \( n \)) from the source peg to the target peg.
3. Move the \( n-1 \) disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.

For 5 disks, we'll apply this recursively.

### Step-by-Step Moves
Let's define the moves step by step. I'll keep track of the disks and their positions after each move.

**Initial state:**
- Peg 0: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
- Peg 1: []
- Peg 2: []

**Move 1:** Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
- Peg 0: [5, 4, 3, 2]
- Peg 1: []
- Peg 2: [1]
Move: [1, 0, 2]

**Move 2:** Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.
- Peg 0: [5, 4, 3]
- Peg 1: [2]
- Peg 2: [1]
Move: [2, 0, 1]

**Move 3:** Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (on top of disk 2).
- Peg 0: [5, 4, 3]
- Peg 1: [2, 1]
- Peg 2: []
Move: [1, 2, 1]

**Move 4:** Move disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
- Peg 0: [5, 4]
- Peg 1: [2, 1]
- Peg 2: [3]
Move: [3, 0, 2]

**Move 5:** Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 0.
- Peg 0: [5, 4, 1]
- Peg 1: [2]
- Peg 2: [3]
Move: [1, 1, 0]

**Move 6:** Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (on top of disk 3).
- Peg 0: [5, 4, 1]
- Peg 1: []
- Peg 2: [3, 2]
Move: [2, 1, 2]

**Move 7:** Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2 (on top of disk 2).
- Peg 0: [5, 4]
- Peg 1: []
- Peg 2: [3, 2, 1]
Move: [1, 0, 2]

**Move 8:** Move disk 4 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.
- Peg 0: [5]
- Peg 1: [4]
- Peg 2: [3, 2, 1]
Move: [4, 0, 1]

**Move 9:** Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (cannot go on Peg 0 as disk 5 is there, but disk 4 is larger, so it's okay).
Wait, no. Disk 1 is on Peg 2, and we want to move it to Peg 1 where disk 4 is. But disk 1 is smaller than disk 4, so it's allowed.
- Peg 0: [5]
- Peg 1: [4, 1]
- Peg 2: [3, 2]
Move: [1, 2, 1]

**Move 10:** Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 0.
- Peg 0: [5, 2]
- Peg 1: [4, 1]
- Peg 2: [3]
Move: [2, 2, 0]

**Move 11:** Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 0 (on top of disk 2).
- Peg 0: [5, 2, 1]
- Peg 1: [4]
- Peg 2: [3]
Move: [1, 1, 0]

**Move 12:** Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (on top of disk 4).
- Peg 0: [5, 2, 1]
- Peg 1: [4, 3]
- Peg 2: []
Move: [3, 2, 1]

**Move 13:** Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
- Peg 0: [5, 2]
- Peg 1: [4, 3]
- Peg 2: [1]
Move: [1, 0, 2]

**Move 14:** Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1 (on top of disk 3).
- Peg 0: [5]
- Peg 1: [4, 3, 2]
- Peg 2: [1]
Move: [2, 0, 1]

**Move 15:** Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (on top of disk 2).
- Peg 0: [5]
- Peg 1: [4, 3, 2, 1]
- Peg 2: []

- Peg 0: []
- Peg 1: [4, 3, 2, 1]

Move: [5, 0, 2]

Now, we need to move disks 4, 3, 2, 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 on top of disk 5.

**Move 17:** Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 0.
- Peg 0: [1]
- Peg 1: [4, 3, 2]

- Peg 1: []
- Peg 2: [5, 4]
Move: [4, 1, 2]

**Move 25:** Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
Wait, no. Disk 1 is on Peg 0, and we want to move it to Peg 2 where disk 4 is. But disk 1 is smaller than disk 4, so it's allowed.
But actually, we should move disk 1 to Peg 1 first to free up disk 2.
