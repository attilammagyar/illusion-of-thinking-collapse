Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 8 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's 8 disks, which is an even number, I remember that the iterative solution might involve moving the smallest disk in a specific pattern. 

First, the minimum number of moves required is 2^8 - 1, which is 255. That's a lot of moves, but the user insists on the full list. The challenge is generating all 255 moves correctly without missing any steps.

Looking at the search results, the iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific direction each time—maybe to the right? Wait, the Wikipedia article mentions that for an even number of disks, the smallest moves to the right, and for odd, to the left. So for 8 disks, each time we move disk 1, it should go to the next peg to the right (0→1→2→0...).

The algorithm steps from the sources say to alternate between moving the smallest and the next possible disk. So the pattern would be: move disk 1, then the next possible non-smallest disk, and repeat. Each time after moving disk 1, there's only one legal move for the non-smallest disk.

But how to translate this into a sequence of moves? Let's think recursively. The recursive approach is to move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary, then move the nth disk to target, then move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target. But for 8 disks, that would generate a lot of steps. However, the user wants the iterative solution, which might be more straightforward to list out.

Another approach from the search results mentions an iterative algorithm where each step follows a specific pattern. For even disks, the movement of the smallest disk is always to the next peg in a clockwise direction (0→1→2→0...), and the non-smallest move is the only legal option available.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Start with all disks on peg 0.
2. The first move is disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (since even number of disks, direction is to the right).
3. Then, move the next possible disk (the smallest available that's not disk 1). Since disk 2 is on peg 0, can we move it? Wait, after moving disk 1, the next move must be the only legal move for a non-smallest disk. So after moving disk 1 to peg 1, the next move is disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.
4. Then move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.
5. Next, move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1.
6. Then move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0.
7. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1.
8. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
9. Then move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2.
10. And so on...

This pattern continues, alternating between moving the smallest disk and the next possible disk. Each time, after moving the smallest disk, there's only one possible move for the next disk. 

But manually listing 255 moves is error-prone. I need a systematic way to generate each move. The iterative algorithm can be implemented as follows:

- For each move number from 1 to 255:
  - If the move number is odd, move the smallest disk (disk 1) in the predetermined direction (right for even n).
  - If the move number is even, make the only legal move not involving the smallest disk.

The direction for the smallest disk alternates each time it's moved. Wait, no—since n is even, the direction is consistently to the right. So each time we move disk 1, it goes to the next peg in the sequence 0→1→2→0...

For the non-smallest moves, after each disk 1 move, there's only one possible move that doesn't involve placing a larger disk on a smaller one.

To generate all moves programmatically, we can use the fact that the Tower of Hanoi has a pattern based on binary representations or using the iterative approach. But since I have to write out all 255 moves, I need to ensure each step is correct.

Alternatively, using the recursive approach, the sequence can be generated by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. For 8 disks, the steps would involve moving 7 disks to peg 1, then moving disk 8 to peg 2, then moving the 7 disks from peg 1 to peg 2. Each of those 7-disk moves would themselves be broken down similarly.

But the recursive approach would generate the moves in a specific order. However, the example given in the query for 3 disks uses a specific sequence. Let's check that example:

For 3 disks, the moves are:
[[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2]]

This follows the pattern of moving disk 1 alternately, then the next disk. Let's see:

Move 1: 1 from 0 to 2
Move 2: 2 from 0 to 1
Move 3: 1 from 2 to 1
Move 4: 3 from 0 to 2
Move 5: 1 from 1 to 0
Move 6: 2 from 1 to 2
Move 7: 1 from 0 to 2

This aligns with the recursive solution where you move n-1 disks, then the nth, then n-1 again. So for 3 disks, the moves are indeed 7 steps.

Applying this to 8 disks, the sequence would be much longer. However, generating it manually is impractical. Instead, I need to find a pattern or algorithm that can be followed to list all 255 moves correctly.

Another approach from the search results mentions an iterative solution where the moves alternate between the smallest disk and the only possible legal move. For even n, the smallest disk moves in a cycle: 0→1→2→0...

Each time after moving the smallest disk, the next move is determined by the two pegs not involved in the previous move. For example, if the smallest was moved from 0→1, the next move is between the other two pegs (0 and 2), choosing the legal move.

But how to track this? Let's outline the steps for the first few moves to see the pattern:

1. Move 1: Disk 1 from 0→1 (smallest move, right direction)
2. Move 2: Disk 2 from 0→2 (only legal move not involving disk 1)
3. Move 3: Disk 1 from 1→2 (smallest move, right direction)
4. Move 4: Disk 3 from 0→1 (only legal move)
5. Move 5: Disk 1 from 2→0 (smallest move, right direction would be 2→0 since after 1→2, next is 2→0)
Wait, but for even n, the direction is right, so 0→1→2→0... So after moving to peg 2, the next would be peg 0.

Wait, maybe the direction is cyclic. For even n, the smallest disk moves right each time: 0→1→2→0→1→2 etc.

So after move 1: 0→1
Move 3: 1→2
Move 5: 2→0
Move 7: 0→1
And so on.

Then, the non-smallest moves are determined by the two pegs not holding the smallest disk. For example, after moving disk 1 to peg 1, the other disks are on pegs 0 and 2. The next move must be between these two pegs, moving the smaller of the top disks. Since peg 0 has disk 2 (assuming n=3), and peg 2 is empty, so move disk 2 from 0→2.

Continuing this pattern, each non-smallest move is between the two pegs that don't have the smallest disk, moving the smaller available disk.

But for 8 disks, this pattern continues, with the smallest disk moving right each time, and the non-smallest moves following the only legal option.

To generate all 255 moves, I need to simulate this process step by step. However, doing this manually is impossible. Instead, I can use the known optimal solution for 8 disks, which requires 255 moves, and structure the answer accordingly.

The search result [3] mentions that 8 disks require 255 moves (2^8 -1). The example in the query for 3 disks uses the recursive approach. Therefore, the correct sequence for 8 disks would follow the same recursive pattern but scaled up.

However, the user insists on the complete list. Since I can't generate all 255 moves manually here, I need to rely on the fact that the optimal solution is known and can be generated algorithmically. The correct sequence would involve recursively moving smaller disks, alternating between pegs as needed.

Given the complexity, the answer must be the full list of moves in the specified format. Since I can't list all 255 here due to length, but the user insists, I must provide it. However, considering the context, perhaps the assistant can generate the correct sequence programmatically, but within the constraints of this exercise, I need to present the correct answer.

Wait, the user provided search results include a YouTube video for 8 disks and a solution stating 255 moves. The exact move sequence isn't in the search results, but the method is described. Therefore, the assistant must generate the sequence based on the algorithm.

Given that, the correct approach is to use the iterative method for even n, moving the smallest disk right each time, and the non-smallest disk moving between the other two pegs in the only legal way.

To generate the moves:

Initialize pegs as [[8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], [], []]
moves = []
direction = 1 (right) for even n

for move_number in 1 to 255:
    if move_number is odd:
        move disk 1 from current peg to next peg in direction
    else:
        determine the two pegs not holding disk 1
        move the smaller of the top disks between those two pegs

Implementing this logic step by step would generate all 255 moves. However, without running the actual code, I need to ensure the sequence is correct.

Alternatively, the recursive approach would generate the moves as follows:

To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:
if n == 1:
    move disk 1 from source to target
else:
    move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using target
    move disk n from source to target
    move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target using source

For 8 disks, the sequence would be:

move 7 disks from 0 to 1 using 2
move disk 8 from 0 to 2
move 7 disks from 1 to 2 using 0

Each of the 7-disk moves would themselves be broken down similarly.

This recursive breakdown would generate the correct sequence, but again, listing all 255 moves is tedious.

Given that the user requires the complete list and the assistant's task is to provide it, the answer must be the full sequence. However, in practice, generating this manually is error-prone. Therefore, the assistant must output the correct sequence based on the known optimal solution, which for 8 disks is a specific list of 255 moves.

Since the search results don't provide the exact list, but the algorithm is known, the assistant must construct it correctly. The key is to follow the iterative approach, ensuring each move alternates between the smallest disk and the only legal non-smallest move.

After careful consideration, the correct move sequence for 8 disks following the iterative method is as follows, starting with moving disk 1 to peg 1, then disk 2 to peg 2, and so on, alternating as described.
