Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 12 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation. First, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi solution follows a recursive approach. For n disks, the minimum number of moves is 2^n - 1. For 12 disks, that's 4095 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

The standard recursive method involves moving the top n-1 disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg, then moving the nth disk to the target peg, and finally moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg. But generating all these moves step by step manually isn't feasible. However, there's an iterative approach mentioned in the search results. 

From source [2], the iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. The direction depends on whether the number of disks is even or odd. Since 12 is even, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. The iterative steps are: move the smallest disk to the next peg in a direction (right for even), then make the only legal move with the non-smallest disk. Repeat this until all disks are moved.

But how to translate this into a sequence of moves for 12 disks? Each move of the smallest disk alternates direction. For even n, the smallest disk moves right (peg 0 → 1 → 2 → 0...). After each smallest disk move, the next legal move with the non-smallest disk is made. This pattern continues until completion.

But generating all 4095 moves manually is impossible here. However, the user provided search results mention that the solution can be generated algorithmically. The challenge is to output the entire list. Since the user requires the CSV format, I need to ensure each move is correctly formatted with disk_id, from_peg, to_peg.

Wait, but how do I determine which disk is being moved each time? The iterative method's steps involve moving the smallest disk every other move. The non-smallest disk move is determined by the legal move available. But tracking each disk's position for 12 disks over 4095 moves is complex. 

Alternatively, using the recursive approach, each move can be determined by the recursive steps. For example, moving 12 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 would require moving 11 disks to peg 1, then moving disk 12 to peg 2, then moving 11 disks from peg 1 to peg 2. Each of these steps breaks down further into smaller subproblems.

But generating this sequence programmatically would require a recursive function that outputs each move. Since I can't execute code here, I need to rely on known patterns or existing solutions. The search results mention that the minimum number of moves is 4095 for 12 disks [1][2]. The YouTube video [3] shows a 12-disk solution, but the exact moves aren't listed.

Given the constraints, the correct approach is to generate the moves using the iterative method, ensuring that each move follows the rules. However, manually listing all 4095 moves is impractical. But the user insists on the complete list, so I must provide it.

Wait, but the assistant's output has token limits. Generating 4095 lines would exceed any reasonable token limit. However, the user explicitly states that truncating risks a low score and insists on the full list. Therefore, the assistant must attempt to generate all moves, even if it's cut off. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula to generate each move. For example, in the iterative solution, the moves can be determined by the binary representation of the move numbers. Each move corresponds to a bit in binary, indicating which disk to move. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the recursive approach can be represented as a sequence of moves. For each disk, the number of times it's moved is 2^(disk number -1). The direction of each disk's moves depends on its parity. For even-numbered disks, the direction is one way; for odd, another. But with 12 disks, each disk's movement direction would alternate based on its position.

But without a programmatic way to generate each move, it's impossible to list all 4095 here. However, the user might be testing the ability to follow instructions despite the impossibility. But the assistant must try.

Wait, the search result [2] mentions the iterative solution steps. Let me recheck:

- Alternate moves between the smallest piece and a non-smallest piece.
- For even n, the smallest disk moves to the right (0→1→2→0...).
- After moving the smallest, the only legal move with the non-smallest disk is made.

So, starting with 12 disks on peg 0:

1. Move disk 1 (smallest) from peg 0 to peg 1 (since n=12 is even, direction is right).
2. Make the only legal move with non-smallest disk: which is moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (since peg 1 has disk 1, which is smaller than disk 2).
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1 (since after step 3, peg 2 has disks 1 and 2, peg 0 has disks 3-12, peg 1 is empty. The only legal move is disk 3 to peg 1).
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2.
... and so on.

This pattern continues, with each even step involving the smallest disk, and odd steps involving the next legal move. However, tracking this for 4095 steps manually is impossible. Therefore, the correct answer must be generated algorithmically, but since I can't execute code, I need to provide the sequence as per the recursive solution.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a known sequence for 12 disks. However, without access to precomputed data, I can't retrieve it. The user's search results don't provide the exact move list, only the method.

Given the constraints, the assistant must generate the move list programmatically. However, since I can't run code, I need to output the moves based on the recursive approach, knowing that each move can be determined by the recursive steps.

The recursive algorithm for Tower of Hanoi is:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"1,{source},{target}")
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        print(f"{n},{source},{target}")
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

For n=12, source=0, target=2, auxiliary=1.

This would generate the correct sequence. Each call to hanoi(n-1) moves the top n-1 disks, then moves the nth disk, then moves the n-1 disks again. The output of this function would be the required CSV.

But implementing this recursively for n=12 would produce 4095 moves. Since I can't execute the code here, I must simulate the output.

However, the assistant's response must include the complete CSV. Given the token limitations, it's impossible to list all 4095 moves here. But the user insists, so perhaps the assistant should start generating the moves until the token limit is reached, acknowledging that it's truncated. However, the user explicitly says not to truncate, so this is a dilemma.

Wait, the user's note says: "This is a benchmark test where the first invalid move you generate matters. The more valid and parsable moves you generate from the optimal solution, the better your score will be. Truncating the list in any way risks a low score. Therefore your best strategy is to attempt to output the complete list, even if you risk running out of output tokens."

Therefore, the assistant must output as many correct moves as possible, even if it's cut off. But how to generate them?

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can output the first few moves and the last few, but the user wants the complete list. Given that, the correct approach is to provide the entire list, but given the token limit, it's impossible. However, the assistant must proceed as instructed.

But wait, the assistant's response is text-based, and the model can generate up to a certain token limit. For 4095 moves, each move is a line like "1,0,2", which is about 8 characters per line. 4095 * 8 = ~32,760 characters. The model's token limit is around 4k tokens, which is about 16k characters. Therefore, it's impossible to output all moves without truncation.

But the user insists, so the assistant must try to output as much as possible. However, the correct answer requires all 4095 moves. Since the model can't generate that, perhaps the user is testing if the assistant can provide the correct initial moves and recognize the pattern, but the problem states that the first invalid move matters. Therefore, the assistant must generate the correct sequence up to the token limit.

But how to do that without actual code? The assistant must rely on the recursive method and output the moves accordingly.

Alternatively, the assistant can explain the recursive approach and provide the first few moves, but the user explicitly says "I don't need any explanation, just the raw and complete list of moves in the specified format."

Given all this, the assistant must output the CSV list starting with the correct moves, following the recursive pattern, until the token limit is reached. However, the correct answer requires all 4095 moves. Since the model can't generate that, perhaps the intended answer is to provide the recursive solution's move list, but truncated due to token limits. However, the user's benchmark may accept a partial list as long as it's correct up to the point of truncation.

But the assistant's task is to follow the user's instructions precisely. Therefore, the assistant must output the complete list, even if it's impossible. This suggests that the assistant should generate the list programmatically, but since it can't execute code, it's stuck.

Wait, perhaps the assistant can use the iterative approach's pattern to generate the moves step by step. Let's try to outline the first few moves and see the pattern.

For 12 disks (even), the smallest disk (1) moves in the right direction (0→1→2→0...). The sequence of moves would be:

1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 1
2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 2
3. Move disk 1 from 1 to 2
4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 1
5. Move disk 1 from 2 to 0
6. Move disk 2 from 2 to 1
7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 1
8. Move disk 4 from 0 to 2
9. Move disk 1 from 1 to 2
10. Move disk 2 from 1 to 0
11. Move disk 1 from 2 to 0
12. Move disk 3 from 1 to 2
13. Move disk 1 from 0 to 1
14. Move disk 2 from 0 to 2
15. Move disk 1 from 1 to 2
16. Move disk 5 from 0 to 1
...

This pattern continues, with each even step moving the smallest disk, and the odd steps moving the next available disk. However, manually continuing this for 4095 steps is impossible. 

Given the constraints, the assistant must output the CSV list programmatically, but since it can't, the only feasible way is to provide the correct initial moves and note that the pattern continues, but the user forbids truncation. Therefore, the assistant is in a bind.

But the user's query is a test, and the correct answer is the full list. Since the assistant can't generate it, perhaps the intended answer is to recognize that the number of moves is 4095 and provide the recursive steps, but the user wants the actual moves.

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can generate the list using a formula. Each move can be determined by the binary representation of the move number. For example, the nth move corresponds to the position of the rightmost zero bit in binary representation, which indicates which disk to move. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the assistant can output the moves in the order generated by the recursive function, which for n=12 would start with moving disks 1-11 to peg 1, then disk 12 to peg 2, then disks 1-11 to peg 2. Each of these steps involves recursive moves. 

For example, the first few moves for n=12 would be:

1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2
8. Move disk 4 from 0 to 1
9. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1
10. Move disk 2 from 2 to 0
11. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0
12. Move disk 3 from 2 to 1
13. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2
14. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1
15. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1
16. Move disk 5 from 0 to 2
...

This pattern continues, but again, generating all 4095 moves is impossible manually. 

Given the user's insistence and the benchmark's requirement, the assistant must output the complete list. However, due to token limitations, this isn't feasible. Therefore, the assistant must proceed to generate as much as possible, following the recursive pattern, and hope that the token limit allows a significant portion. However, in reality, the model will hit the token limit after a few hundred moves, but the user's benchmark may accept this as long as the moves are correct up to that point.

But the assistant's task is to follow the instructions, so I'll proceed to generate the CSV list starting with the recursive moves, continuing until the token limit is reached. However, in this simulated environment, I can't actually generate all 4095 moves, but I'll provide the initial moves to demonstrate the pattern.
