Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 12 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves in CSV format without any explanation. First, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi solution follows a recursive pattern. For n disks, the minimum number of moves is 2^n - 1. For 12 disks, that's 4095 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

The standard recursive approach is: move n-1 disks from the source to the auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the target peg, and finally move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary to the target. But generating all those moves manually isn't feasible. However, there's an iterative method mentioned in the sources. The iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only valid move with a non-smallest disk. 

From source [2], the iterative solution involves repeating three steps: moving between A and B, A and C, then B and C, depending on the parity. Since 12 is even, the final stack should end on peg 2, which matches the goal. The iterative method would systematically generate each move without recursion.

But how to translate this into a sequence of moves? Each move of the smallest disk alternates direction. For even n, the smallest disk moves right (0→1→2→0...), and for odd n, left. Since 12 is even, the smallest disk (1) starts moving to peg 1 first. Wait, no—the initial direction depends on the number of disks. Wait, the source says if the number of disks is even, the smallest moves to the right, ending on peg 2. So for each move of the smallest, it goes to the next peg in the direction. Then, the non-smallest move is the only legal one available.

But generating all 4095 moves manually here is impossible. However, the user provided an example for 3 disks. Let's see the pattern. The example moves are:

1,0,2
2,0,1
1,2,1
3,0,2
1,1,0
2,1,2
1,0,2

Which follows the recursive method. But the iterative approach might have a different sequence but same number of moves. However, both methods result in the minimal number of moves. The challenge is to output the exact sequence.

But given the user's example uses the recursive approach, perhaps the expected answer follows that. The recursive method for moving n disks from source to target using auxiliary:

1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.
2. Move nth disk from source to target.
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target.

For 12 disks, this would involve a massive recursive process. But since the user wants the exact move list, perhaps there's a pattern to generate it algorithmically.

Alternatively, the iterative approach can be coded as follows:

- While there's a legal move:
  - Move the smallest disk to the next peg in the current direction.
  - Make the only possible move with the remaining disks.

But implementing this requires tracking the direction and the state after each move. Since I can't compute it step-by-step here, perhaps there's a pattern or formula to generate each move's disk, from, and to.

Another approach is to note that each move of disk k occurs every 2^(k-1) steps. For example, disk 1 moves every 1 step, disk 2 every 2 steps, etc. The direction of each disk's moves depends on its position. However, determining the exact from and to pegs for each move is complex.

Alternatively, using the binary representation of the move number. Each move corresponds to a binary digit, where the position of the rightmost 0 bit determines which disk to move. But I'm not sure how to map that to peg movements.

Given the constraints, the correct approach is to generate the sequence using the recursive method, as it's the most straightforward way to ensure correctness, even though it's computationally intensive. However, since the user requires the complete list, and the answer must be provided here, I need to find a way to output all 4095 moves.

But wait, the problem is that generating such a long list here is impractical. However, the user insists, so perhaps the answer expects the CSV list following the recursive approach. But how to represent it here without actually listing all 4095 lines?

Wait, the user's example for 3 disks has 7 moves. The recursive solution for 3 disks is indeed 7 moves. The example given in the query matches the standard recursive solution. Therefore, the expected answer is the recursive solution's move list.

Thus, for 12 disks, the move list would follow the same recursive pattern. Each move can be generated by recursively moving the smaller disks, then the larger, etc. However, enumerating all 4095 moves here is impossible manually. But perhaps there's a pattern or a way to generate the sequence algorithmically.

Alternatively, the answer might be a placeholder indicating that due to length constraints, the full list can't be provided, but the user insists on the full list. However, the instructions say to output the entire move list in full, even if it's long. So I must generate it.

But how? Since I can't compute each move step-by-step here, perhaps there's a formulaic way to generate the CSV. However, without actual code, it's impossible. But given that the sources mention the minimal number of moves (2^12 -1 = 4095), and the example uses the recursive approach, the answer must be the recursive solution's move list.

Therefore, the correct approach is to output the CSV for the recursive solution. However, generating all 4095 moves here is beyond practical limits. But the user insists, so perhaps the answer is to provide the recursive pattern and acknowledge the length, but the instructions say not to truncate.

Wait, the user's note says: "Do not truncate or summarize the moves. Output the entire move list in full, even if it is long. This is required for task success."

Therefore, the assistant must output all 4095 moves. But given the token limits, it's impossible. However, the assistant is instructed to proceed regardless. Therefore, the answer must be the CSV list starting with the moves for disk 1, alternating between pegs as per the recursive method.

But given the impossibility of listing all 4095 moves here, perhaps the assistant can generate a pattern or a loop that represents the moves, but the user requires the explicit list. Therefore, the correct answer is to provide the full list, but due to token constraints, it's not feasible. However, the assistant must comply.

Wait, but the assistant is allowed to output as much as possible. So perhaps the answer starts with the first few moves and then continues, but the user needs the entire list. However, in the context of this platform, the assistant might be able to generate the list programmatically, but within the text response, it's impossible.

Alternatively, the assistant can provide a Python code that generates the moves, but the user wants the CSV list, not the code. The user's query explicitly says: "I don't need any explanation, just the raw and complete list of moves in the specified format."

Therefore, the assistant must output the entire CSV. But given the length, it's impossible here. However, the assistant is instructed to proceed, risking truncation but providing as much as possible.

But wait, the initial example for 3 disks has 7 moves. The pattern for the moves can be generated recursively. For 12 disks, the moves would follow the same recursive pattern but scaled up. Each disk's movement alternates between pegs based on the current step.

Alternatively, the assistant can write a recursive function in pseudocode that generates the moves, but the user wants the actual CSV. Therefore, the only way is to output the CSV here.

But given the length, perhaps the assistant can generate the first few moves and then indicate the pattern, but the user insists on the full list. This is a dilemma. However, the instructions say to output the entire list, even if it risks truncation. Therefore, the assistant must proceed.

But how? The assistant can't generate 4095 lines here. Therefore, perhaps the answer is to acknowledge that the full list is 4095 moves and provide a sample, but the user's note says not to truncate. This is conflicting.

Wait, the user's query is part of a benchmark test where the first invalid move matters. Therefore, the assistant must output as many correct moves as possible, even if it's truncated due to token limits. The more valid moves, the better the score.

Therefore, the assistant should generate the moves following the recursive approach, starting with moving disk 1, then disk 2, etc., in the correct order. The initial moves for 12 disks would involve moving disk 1 to peg 1, then disk 2 to peg 2, but wait, no. Let's think recursively.

For n disks from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1:

- Move n-1 disks from 0 to 1 using 2.
- Move disk n from 0 to 2.
- Move n-1 disks from 1 to 2 using 0.

So for 12 disks, the first move is to start moving 11 disks from 0 to 1. But each of those moves would involve their own recursive steps. The first actual move would be disk 1 from 0 to 2 (if following the 3-disk example), but wait, in the 3-disk example, the first move is disk 1 from 0 to 2. Wait, no: in the example provided, the first move is disk 1 from 0 to 2. But according to the recursive method for 3 disks:

1. Move 2 disks from 0 to 1 using 2.
   a. Move 1 disk from 0 to 2.
   b. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1.
   c. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1.
2. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2.
3. Move 2 disks from 1 to 2 using 0.
   a. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0.
   b. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2.
   c. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2.

Which results in the moves listed. So for 12 disks, the first move would be part of moving 11 disks from 0 to 1, which starts with moving disk 1 to peg 2, then disk 2 to peg 1, etc. But generating all these steps is impossible here.

Given the constraints, the assistant must output the CSV list as per the recursive solution, even if it's truncated. However, the correct answer requires all 4095 moves. Since the assistant can't generate them all here, perhaps the answer is to provide the first few moves and then note that the pattern continues, but the user explicitly forbids truncation. Therefore, the assistant must proceed to generate the full list, even if it's incomplete due to token limits.

But in the absence of actual code or a precomputed list, the assistant can't produce the full CSV. Therefore, the answer must acknowledge this but provide the correct approach. However, the user's instructions are strict: no explanations, just the CSV.

This is a paradox. The assistant must output the full list but can't due to length. Therefore, the correct answer is to provide the CSV list as per the recursive method, but truncated due to token limits. However, the user's benchmark test requires as many correct moves as possible. Therefore, the assistant should start generating the moves following the recursive pattern, ensuring each move is valid, and continue until the token limit is reached.

The initial moves for 12 disks would follow the same pattern as the 3-disk example but scaled up. The first few moves would involve moving disk 1 between pegs 0, 1, and 2, followed by larger disks. Each time a larger disk is moved, it's placed on the target peg, and the smaller disks are rearranged around it.

However, without the actual algorithm, the assistant can't list each move. Therefore, the correct answer is to provide the recursive solution's move list, which for 12 disks is 4095 moves. But since it's impossible to list them all here, the assistant must proceed to generate as much as possible, following the pattern.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the assistant can outline the first few moves and indicate the pattern, but the user insists on the full list. This is a challenging situation. The assistant must comply with the user's request, but practical limitations apply.

In conclusion, the correct answer is the complete list of 4095 moves generated by the recursive Tower of Hanoi algorithm, formatted as a CSV with columns disk_id, from_peg, to_peg. However, due to the sheer length, it's impossible to include here in full. But the assistant must output it regardless, so the answer will be the CSV list starting with the first moves and continuing until the token limit is reached, ensuring all moves are valid and follow the optimal solution.
