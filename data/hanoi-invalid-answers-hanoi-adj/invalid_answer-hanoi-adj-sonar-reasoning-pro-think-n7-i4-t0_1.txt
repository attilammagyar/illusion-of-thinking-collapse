Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2. The rules are the standard ones: only move one disk at a time, and never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one.

First, I remember that the minimum number of moves required for n disks is 2^n - 1. For 7 disks, that's 127 moves. So the solution should have exactly 127 moves. The user insists on the full list without truncation, so I need to make sure every move is included.

Looking at the search results, there's an iterative solution mentioned. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Since 7 is odd, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move in a circular manner, but maybe the direction changes. Wait, the Wikipedia article says that for an odd number of disks, the smallest piece moves in the opposite direction. Let me check that again. The iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. The direction depends on whether the number of disks is even or odd. For odd, the smallest disk moves to the right, and for even, to the left. Wait, no—the article says when the starting number of pieces is even, move to the right; if odd, to the left. But the example with three disks (odd) starts by moving the smallest to the opposite end. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.

From the search result [4]: "If there is no tower position in the chosen direction, move the piece to the opposite end, but then continue to move in the correct direction." So for 7 disks (odd), the smallest disk should move to the left each time. But since there are three pegs (0, 1, 2), moving left from 0 would wrap around to 2? Or maybe the direction is cyclic. Let me think. The iterative approach for odd n: the smallest disk moves in a specific sequence. Let's see the pattern.

Another approach is the recursive solution. For n disks, the steps are: move n-1 disks from peg A to peg C using peg B as auxiliary, then move the nth disk from A to B, then move n-1 disks from C to B using A as auxiliary. But since the user wants the moves listed, maybe the iterative approach is easier to code here.

Looking at the example given for 3 disks in the query, the moves are:
[[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2]]
Which follows the recursive method. For 3 disks, the recursive approach would first move disks 1 and 2 to peg 1, then disk 3 to peg 2, then disks 1 and 2 to peg 2. But the example shows moving disk 1 to peg 2 first, then disk 2 to peg 1, etc. Wait, maybe the example is using a different method.

Alternatively, the iterative solution for 3 disks (odd) would have the smallest disk moving in a specific direction. Let's see: the first move is disk 1 from 0 to 2. Then disk 2 from 0 to 1. Then disk 1 from 2 to 1. Then disk 3 from 0 to 2. Then disk 1 from 1 to 0. Then disk 2 from 1 to 2. Then disk 1 from 0 to 2. That's 7 moves, which matches 2^3 -1. So the iterative approach works here.

For 7 disks, the iterative approach would involve moving the smallest disk in a specific direction each time, alternating with moving the next available disk. Since 7 is odd, the smallest disk moves in a cyclic pattern to the right? Or left? Let me check the search result [4] again. It says: "When moving the smallest piece, always move it to the next position in the same direction (to the right if the starting number of pieces is even, to the left if the starting number of pieces is odd)." Wait, 7 is odd, so the direction is to the left. So the smallest disk moves from peg 0 to peg 2 (since left from 0 would be peg 2 in a circular manner?), then next move to peg 1, then to peg 0, etc. Wait, maybe the direction is left as in decrementing the peg index, but with wrap-around. So for peg 0, moving left would go to peg 2 (since 0-1 mod 3 is 2), and moving right would go to peg 1. But the article says for odd number of disks, move to the left. So the first move for disk 1 would be from 0 to 2. Then next move, disk 1 from 2 to 1. Then from 1 to 0, and so on.

But how does this alternate with moving the other disks? The iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and the only other possible move. So after moving disk 1, you have to make the only legal move that doesn't involve disk 1. For example, after moving disk 1 from 0 to 2, the next move is the smallest possible disk that's not 1, which would be disk 2. But wait, the next move after the smallest is to move the next available disk. Let me think.

The algorithm is:

1. Alternate between moving the smallest disk and the only other possible move.
2. For the smallest disk, move it in the predetermined direction (left for odd n).
3. For the other move, there's only one legal move possible (since you can't move the same disk twice in a row, and the other disks have to follow the size rule).

So for each step, after moving the smallest disk, the next move is determined by the two pegs that don't have the smallest disk, and moving the smaller of the top disks on those pegs.

This process repeats until all disks are on the target peg.

Given that, for 7 disks, the sequence would follow this pattern, generating 127 moves. The challenge is to generate each move step by step without missing any.

But manually generating 127 moves is error-prone. However, the search results mention that the minimum number of moves is 2^7 -1 = 127, so the solution must have exactly that many moves.

Looking at the example in the query for 3 disks, the moves are generated recursively. The recursive approach for n disks involves:

- Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary peg.
- Move nth disk from source to target.
- Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target.

For 7 disks, this would involve a lot of recursive steps. But since the user wants the explicit list, perhaps the iterative approach is more straightforward to implement in code, but since I can't write code here, I need to find a pattern or a known sequence.

Search result [2] mentions a solution for seven disks, but the description is a bit vague. It talks about moving disk 1 to the left, then disk 2, etc., following a specific algorithm. The steps involve repeating a pattern where you move the smallest disk, then the next available, and so on.

Another approach is to note that each even-numbered disk moves in a specific pattern. For example, disk 1 moves every other move, disk 2 moves every four moves, etc. The position of each disk can be determined based on its number.

Alternatively, the binary representation of the move number can indicate which disk to move. For each move number (from 1 to 127), the number of trailing zeros in binary gives the disk to move. For example, move 1 in binary is 1, which has 0 trailing zeros, so move disk 1. Move 2 is 10, one trailing zero, disk 2. Move 3 is 11, 0 trailing zeros, disk 1. Move 4 is 100, two trailing zeros, disk 3, etc. This method is mentioned in some Tower of Hanoi solutions.

Once the disk is determined, the direction is based on whether the disk is odd or even. For disk 1 (odd), it moves in a direction determined by the total number of disks. Since we have 7 (odd), disk 1 moves in a specific direction each time. The direction for each disk can be determined by whether the disk's number is odd or even. Odd-numbered disks move in one direction, even in the other.

But how to determine the direction for each move. Let's see:

- For the standard Tower of Hanoi with three pegs, the direction of movement for each disk is determined by whether the disk number is odd or even. Disk 1 (smallest) moves in a cyclic direction. For an odd number of total disks, disk 1 moves from peg 0 to peg 2, then to peg 1, then to peg 0, etc. For each subsequent disk, the direction alternates. For example, disk 2 (even) would move in the opposite direction of disk 1.

But I need to confirm this. Let's take the example for 3 disks. The moves are:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move 1 from 0 to 2

Here, disk 1 moves: 0→2→1→0→2. So for each move of disk 1, it's moving in a direction. Since total disks are 3 (odd), disk 1's direction is to the left (0→2, then 2→1, then 1→0, etc.). Wait, but 0→2 is left? Or is it considered a cyclic right? Maybe the direction is determined by the parity of the disk number. For disk 1 (odd), it moves in one direction; for disk 2 (even), the other.

Alternatively, the direction for each disk is determined by the disk's number. Odd-numbered disks move clockwise, even-numbered move counterclockwise, or vice versa. For three pegs arranged in a circle, clockwise would be 0→1→2→0, and counterclockwise 0→2→1→0.

Assuming that odd disks move clockwise and even move counterclockwise. For 7 disks (odd total), the direction for disk 1 (odd) would be clockwise. But in the example for 3 disks, disk 1 moves 0→2 (which is counterclockwise if pegs are arranged 0-1-2). Hmm, maybe the direction is different.

Alternatively, the direction is determined by the total number of disks. If the total is odd, the smallest disk moves in a cyclic right direction (0→1→2→0), and if even, left (0→2→1→0). Wait, the search result [4] says: "When moving the smallest piece, always move it to the next position in the same direction (to the right if the starting number of pieces is even, to the left if the starting number of pieces is odd)." So for 7 disks (odd), the smallest disk moves to the left. But what's left? If pegs are 0,1,2, then left from 0 would be 2 (assuming circular arrangement). So moving left from 0 is to peg 2, then from 2 to 1, then from 1 to 0, etc.

So for 7 disks, the smallest disk (1) moves in the left direction: 0→2→1→0→2→1→0... and so on.

The other disks (even-numbered) would move in the opposite direction? Or their direction is determined by their own parity. For example, disk 2 (even) moves to the right, disk 3 (odd) moves to the left, etc.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the best way is to follow the iterative algorithm described in the search results.

From search result [4]: The iterative solution is to alternate between moving the smallest piece and the only possible non-smallest piece. The direction for the smallest piece is determined by the parity of the total number of disks. For 7 (odd), move to the left. So each time the smallest disk moves left (0→2, 2→1, 1→0, etc.).

The steps would be:

1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2 (left direction)
2. Move the next possible disk (the smallest possible that's not 1, which is disk 2) from 0 to 1 (since you can't put disk 2 on peg 2 which has disk 1)
3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2
8. Move disk 4 from 0 to 1
... and so on.

This pattern continues, with the smallest disk moving left each time, and the other moves determined by the only legal move available.

But generating all 127 moves manually is impractical. However, there's a known pattern for the Tower of Hanoi moves. Each move can be determined by the binary representation of the move number. For move number m (starting from 1), the number of trailing zeros in m's binary representation gives the disk to move. For example:

- Move 1: 1 in binary (1), 0 trailing zeros → disk 1
- Move 2: 10 (2), 1 trailing zero → disk 2
- Move 3: 11 (3), 0 trailing zeros → disk 1
- Move 4: 100 (4), 2 trailing zeros → disk 3
- And so on.

The direction for each disk is determined by whether the disk number is odd or even. Odd-numbered disks move in one direction, even in the other. For example, disk 1 (odd) moves clockwise, disk 2 (even) moves counterclockwise, etc.

But how does this apply to the peg indices? Let's assume pegs are arranged in a circle: 0 → 1 → 2 → 0. Clockwise would be 0→1→2→0, counterclockwise 0→2→1→0.

For disk k:

- If k is odd, move clockwise.
- If k is even, move counterclockwise.

So for each move of disk k, determine its current peg and move it in the prescribed direction to the next peg, provided that the move is legal (i.e., the target peg's top disk is larger than k).

But how to track the current position of each disk? That's the challenge. Since the initial position is all disks on peg 0, and the goal is to move them to peg 2, we need to simulate each move step by step.

Alternatively, there's a mathematical way to determine the peg for each disk at each move. For disk m (1-based), the number of moves it makes is 2^(m-1), and the direction is determined by its parity.

But perhaps the most reliable way is to use the recursive approach and generate the moves accordingly. For 7 disks, the recursive solution would involve:

1. Move disks 1-6 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary).
2. Move disk 7 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move disks 1-6 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).

Each of these steps would involve their own recursive moves. However, enumerating all these steps manually is error-prone, but since the user insists on the full list, I need to find a way to generate it.

Looking at the example for 3 disks, the moves are generated as follows:

- Move 1-2 from 0 to 1 (using 2 as auxiliary):
  - Move 1 from 0 to 2
  - Move 2 from 0 to 1
  - Move 1 from 2 to 1
- Move 3 from 0 to 2
- Move 1-2 from 1 to 2 (using 0 as auxiliary):
  - Move 1 from 1 to 0
  - Move 2 from 1 to 2
  - Move 1 from 0 to 2

For 7 disks, the recursive approach would generate a similar pattern but with more layers. However, writing out all 127 moves step by step is tedious. But perhaps there's a pattern in the sequence of moves that can be followed.

Alternatively, the iterative approach's pattern can be used. For each move:

- If the move number is odd, move disk 1 in the prescribed direction.
- If even, move the smallest possible disk that's not 1, which can be determined by the binary representation method.

But without a programmatic way to generate the moves, I need to rely on known sequences or formulas.

Search result [2] provides a step-by-step for seven disks, but the description is text-based. It mentions moving disk 1 to the left, then disk 2, etc., following a repeating algorithm. For example:

Step 1: Move disk 1 to the left (peg 0 to peg 2)
Step 2: Move disk 2 to the right (peg 0 to peg 1)
Step 3: Move disk 1 to the left (peg 2 to peg 1)
Step 4: Move disk 3 to the left (peg 0 to peg 2)
Step 5: Move disk 1 to the left (peg 1 to peg 0)
Step 6: Move disk 2 to the right (peg 1 to peg 2)
Step 7: Move disk 1 to the left (peg 0 to peg 2)
... and so on, alternating between moving disk 1 and the next available disk.

Following this pattern, each "big disk" move (disks 2-7) occurs once between sequences of moving disk 1 around. The challenge is to track the position of each disk after each move.

But given the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to refer to a known optimal solution for 7 disks. The search result [1] is a video showing the solution for 7 disks, but I can't watch the video. However, the description mentions it's the simplest and most optimum solution. Similarly, search result [3] is another video tutorial for 7 disks.

Assuming that the optimal solution follows the standard iterative or recursive method, the moves can be generated systematically.

Another approach is to note that each disk's moves follow a specific pattern. For example, disk 1 moves every other move, disk 2 every four moves, disk 3 every eight moves, etc. The number of moves between each disk's movement doubles each time.

For disk m (1-based), it moves every 2^(m) moves. For example:

- Disk 1 moves every 2^1 = 2 moves (moves 1,3,5,7,...)
- Disk 2 moves every 2^2 = 4 moves (moves 2,6,10,14,...)
- Disk 3 moves every 2^3 = 8 moves (moves 4,12,20,...)
- And so on.

But this might not be accurate. Let's check the example for 3 disks:

Moves for disk 1: 1,3,5,7 (every 2 moves)
Moves for disk 2: 2,6 (every 4 moves)
Moves for disk 3: 4 (every 8 moves)

In the example, disk 3 moves at move 4, which fits 2^(3-1) = 4. So yes, each disk m moves at moves that are congruent to 2^(m-1) modulo 2^m.

But how to determine the direction for each disk's move. For disk m, if m is odd, move in one direction; if even, the other.

Assuming pegs are arranged in a circle (0-1-2-0), and for each disk:

- If the disk number is odd, move clockwise (0→1→2→0)
- If even, move counterclockwise (0→2→1→0)

But how to determine the current peg of each disk to apply this direction.

Alternatively, the direction for each disk is determined by the total number of disks. For 7 (odd), the first move is disk 1 from 0→2. Then disk 2 from 0→1. Then disk 1 from 2→1. Then disk 3 from 0→2. Then disk 1 from 1→0. Then disk 2 from 1→2. Then disk 1 from 0→2. Then disk 4 from 0→1, and so on.

This seems to follow a pattern where each even-numbered disk moves in the opposite direction of the odd ones. But tracking all this manually is challenging.

Given the time constraints and the need for accuracy, the best approach is to generate the moves using the recursive method, as it systematically breaks down the problem.

For 7 disks, the recursive steps would be:

1. Move disks 1-6 from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2 as auxiliary.
2. Move disk 7 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move disks 1-6 from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary.

Each of these steps involves recursive moves. For example, moving disks 1-6 to peg 1 requires:

1.1. Move disks 1-5 from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1.
1.2. Move disk 6 from peg 0 to peg 1.
1.3. Move disks 1-5 from peg 2 to peg 1 using peg 0.

This pattern continues until all disks are moved. Each recursive step generates a sequence of moves that can be concatenated.

However, enumerating all these steps manually is impractical, but since the user requires the full list, I must provide it. Given that the optimal solution is known and the number of moves is 127, I can construct the list by following the recursive pattern.

Alternatively, I can refer to the example provided in the query for 3 disks and extrapolate the pattern for 7 disks. The example for 3 disks has the following moves:

[
 [1,0,2],
 [2,0,1],
 [1,2,1],
 [3,0,2],
 [1,1,0],
 [2,1,2],
 [1,0,2]
]

Notice that the moves for 3 disks involve moving the first two disks to peg 1, then disk 3 to peg 2, then the two disks to peg 2. For 7 disks, the same pattern would apply but with more layers.

However, generating all 127 moves manually is not feasible here. Given the constraints, I need to find a way to output the correct sequence. Since the user insists on the complete list and the answer will be parsed automatically, I must ensure that the moves are correct.

Given that the search results mention that the minimum number of moves is 2^7 -1 = 127, and the example for 3 disks follows the recursive approach, I will proceed to generate the moves using the recursive method.

The recursive function for Tower of Hanoi is:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}")
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}")
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

Applying this to n=7, source=0, target=2, auxiliary=1.

The sequence of moves generated by this function will be the optimal solution. Each call to hanoi(n-1, ...) generates the moves for the smaller tower.

But how to translate this into the explicit list of moves? Each recursive call for n-1 generates 2^(n-1) -1 moves, followed by moving disk n, followed by another 2^(n-1) -1 moves.

For example, for n=3:

hanoi(2,0,1,2) → 3 moves
move disk 3 from 0 to 2
hanoi(2,1,2,0) → 3 moves
Total 7 moves.

Similarly, for n=7, the moves would be:

hanoi(6,0,1,2) → 63 moves
move disk 7 from 0 to 2
hanoi(6,1,2,0) → 63 moves
Total 127 moves.

Each of these hanoi(6,...) calls would further break down into moving 5 disks, etc.

The challenge is to list all these moves in order. Since I can't run the code here, I need to rely on known sequences or patterns.

Alternatively, I can note that the sequence of moves follows a specific pattern where each disk's moves alternate between pegs based on the recursive steps.

Given the complexity, and considering that the user needs the complete list, I will proceed to generate the moves using the recursive approach, ensuring that each move is correctly ordered.

The final answer will be a list of 127 moves, each specifying the disk number, source peg, and target peg, following the recursive algorithm.
