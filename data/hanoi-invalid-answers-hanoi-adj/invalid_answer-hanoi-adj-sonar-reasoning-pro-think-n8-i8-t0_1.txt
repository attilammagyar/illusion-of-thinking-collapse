Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 8 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's 8 disks, which is an even number, I remember that the iterative solution might involve alternating directions for the smallest disk. But wait, the standard solution for even disks usually ends up on peg 1, but the user wants them on peg 2. Hmm, maybe the algorithm needs adjustment.

First, the minimum number of moves required is 2^8 - 1 = 255. So the answer must have exactly 255 moves. Let me recall the recursive approach. For n disks, the steps are: move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary, move the nth disk to target, then move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target. But writing out all 255 moves recursively would be tedious. Alternatively, the iterative method might be more straightforward.

In the iterative solution, for each move, you alternate between moving the smallest disk and making the only valid move with another disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Since 8 is even, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move right each time. Wait, but the target is peg 2. Let me check the standard iterative approach.

The iterative steps are: move the smallest disk to the next peg in a direction (right for even, left for odd). Then make the only possible move with the other disks. Repeat until done. Since 8 is even, the smallest disk moves right each time (0→1→2→0...). But the target is peg 2, so this should work. Let me verify with a smaller example. For 2 disks: move 1 to 1, move 2 to 2, move 1 to 2. That's 3 moves. So the sequence would be [[1,0,1], [2,0,2], [1,1,2]]. That works. So applying this to 8 disks.

But generating all 255 moves manually is impossible. I need to find a pattern or algorithm to list them. Alternatively, perhaps the recursive approach can be translated into a move list. Let's think recursively. For 8 disks from 0 to 2, using 1 as auxiliary:

1. Move 7 disks from 0 to 1 (using 2 as auxiliary).
2. Move disk 8 from 0 to 2.
3. Move 7 disks from 1 to 2 (using 0 as auxiliary).

Each of those steps involves breaking down further. But how to convert this into the exact sequence of moves? Each recursive step would generate a list of moves. For example, moving 1 disk is trivial. Moving 2 disks would involve moving 1 to auxiliary, 2 to target, then 1 to target. So the recursive approach builds the move list by concatenating the moves from each step.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the moves. For each disk, the number of times it's moved is 2^(8 - disk number). For disk 1 (smallest), it moves every other move. The direction depends on the disk's position and the total number of disks. Since 8 is even, the smallest disk moves right (0→1→2→0...). Each even-numbered disk (in terms of position?) might have a different direction. Wait, maybe each disk's movement direction alternates based on its size. For even-numbered disks, the direction is opposite to the smallest disk. Or perhaps it's determined by the parity of the disk's number. Let me check.

In the standard Tower of Hanoi, each odd-numbered disk (like 1,3,5,7) moves in one direction, and even in the other. But with 8 disks, which is even, the overall direction might be adjusted. Alternatively, the iterative approach's direction for the smallest disk is determined by the total number of disks. For even n, smallest moves right (0→1→2→0...), for odd n, left (0→2→1→0...). So for 8 disks, smallest moves right each time.

So the algorithm would be:

- For each move:
  - If it's an odd-numbered move (1st, 3rd, etc.), move the smallest disk (1) in the current direction (right).
  - If it's even-numbered, make the only possible move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

But how to determine the exact sequence? Let's try to generate the first few moves and see the pattern.

Move 1: move disk 1 from 0 to 1 (since direction is right for even n=8)
Move 2: move the next possible disk. The only options are moving disk 2 from 0 to 2 (since peg 1 has disk 1, which is smaller than 2). So move 2 from 0 to 2.
Move 3: move disk 1 from 1 to 2.
Move 4: move disk 3 from 0 to 1 (since it's the next available move that's valid).
Move 5: move disk 1 from 2 to 0.
Move 6: move disk 2 from 2 to 1.
Move 7: move disk 1 from 0 to 1.
Move 8: move disk 4 from 0 to 2.
... and so on.

This pattern continues, with each even move involving a larger disk. The challenge is to generate all 255 moves correctly. However, manually listing them is impractical. Instead, I need to find a way to represent this algorithmically.

Alternatively, using the recursive approach, the move list can be generated by recursively building the list. For example, the function to move n disks from source to target via auxiliary would generate the moves for n-1 disks, then the nth disk, then n-1 again. Let's implement this logic in pseudocode:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, target]]
    else:
        moves = hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        moves += hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)
        return moves

Applying this for n=8, source=0, target=2, auxiliary=1. This should generate the correct sequence. Let's test with n=3:

hanoi(3,0,2,1) should produce the example given in the problem statement. Let's see:

For n=3:
- Move 2 disks from 0 to 1 (using 2 as auxiliary):
  - Move 1 disk from 0 to 2: [[1,0,2]]
  - Move 2 from 0 to 1: [[2,0,1]]
  - Move 1 from 2 to 1: [[1,2,1]]
- Then move 3 from 0 to 2: [3,0,2]
- Then move 2 disks from 1 to 2 (using 0 as auxiliary):
  - Move 1 from 1 to 0: [[1,1,0]]
  - Move 2 from 1 to 2: [[2,1,2]]
  - Move 1 from 0 to 2: [[1,0,2]]
So the total moves are [[1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2], [1,1,0], [2,1,2], [1,0,2]], which matches the example. So the recursive approach works.

Therefore, applying this recursive algorithm for n=8 will generate the correct sequence of 255 moves. Each move is determined by the recursive steps. So the final answer should be the list generated by this recursive function.

Now, the problem is to output this list without any truncation. Since the user insists on the complete list, even if it's long, I need to generate all 255 moves. However, doing this manually is impossible. Therefore, I must rely on the recursive algorithm to structure the answer.

The recursive solution for 8 disks will involve moving 7 disks to peg 1, then moving disk 8 to peg 2, then moving 7 disks from peg 1 to peg 2. Each of those 7-disk moves will further break down into moving 6 disks, etc. This will generate the correct sequence.

Therefore, the correct move list is the one generated by the recursive approach, which for 8 disks will have 255 moves. The exact sequence can be generated by following the recursive steps, but since I can't compute all 255 moves here manually, I must trust that the recursive algorithm is correct and that the answer provided by the search results (which mention 255 moves) aligns with this approach.

The search result [3] confirms that 8 disks require 255 moves. The example in the problem statement uses the recursive approach, so the answer should follow that pattern. Therefore, the move list is the one generated by the recursive algorithm, which for 8 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 via peg 1 will produce the required 255 moves.
