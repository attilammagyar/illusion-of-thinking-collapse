Sorry, the move list was truncated due to output limits. For the Tower of Hanoi with 12 disks, the optimal solution requires \(2^{12} - 1 = 4095\) moves. The moves above are correct and follow the optimal recursive solution, but the full list cannot fit in a single response due to output length constraints.

If you need the complete move list, you can generate it programmatically with the following Python code:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append((1, source, target))
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
        moves.append((n, source, target))
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(12, 0, 2, 1, moves)
print("disk_id,from_peg,to_peg")
for move in moves:
    print(f"{move[0]},{move[1]},{move[2]}")
```

This will output the complete, correct, and optimal move list in the format you requested.
