Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves in the specified format without any truncation. First, I remember that the minimum number of moves required for n disks is 2^n - 1. For 7 disks, that's 127 moves. So the solution should have exactly 127 steps.

The iterative solution mentioned in the sources alternates moving the smallest disk and another disk. For an odd number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Since 7 is odd, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move cyclically between pegs. The sources also mention that for an odd number of disks, the stack ends up on peg C (which is peg 2 in this case), which matches the goal configuration.

I need to generate each move step-by-step. Let's start by moving disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Then, the next non-smallest disk move would be disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1. Then move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1, and so on. Each time, the smallest disk alternates between pegs, and the other moves are determined by the only legal move available.

Wait, but manually writing out 127 moves is error-prone. Maybe there's a pattern or recursive approach. However, the user insists on the full list. Let me check the example given for 3 disks. The solution there took 7 moves. The pattern for 3 disks was moving the smallest disk in a cycle, then moving the next available disk. Applying this recursively for 7 disks.

Alternatively, the iterative approach: for each move, if it's an odd-numbered move, move the smallest disk. If even, move the next available disk. The direction for the smallest disk depends on the parity of the number of disks. Since 7 is odd, the smallest disk moves right (from peg 0 to 2, then 2 to 1, then 1 to 0, etc.).

Let me try to generate the first few moves to see the pattern:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move 1 from 0 to 2
... and so on.

This follows the iterative method. Each time, after moving the smallest disk, the next move is the only possible legal move with the non-smallest disk. Repeating this pattern until all disks are on peg 2.

But generating all 127 moves correctly is challenging. I need to ensure that each move follows the rules and that the peg states are accurately tracked. Let's attempt to list them step by step, keeping track of each peg's state after each move.

Starting with peg0: [7,6,5,4,3,2,1], peg1: [], peg2: []

Move 1: Move disk 1 from peg0 to peg2. Now peg0: [7,6,5,4,3,2], peg2: [1].

Move 2: Move disk 2 from peg0 to peg1. Peg0: [7,6,5,4,3], peg1: [2].

Move 3: Move disk 1 from peg2 to peg1. Peg1: [2,1], peg2: [].

Move 4: Move disk 3 from peg0 to peg2. Peg0: [7,6,5,4], peg2: [3].

Move 5: Move disk 1 from peg1 to peg0. Peg0: [7,6,5,4,1], peg1: [2].

Move 6: Move disk 2 from peg1 to peg2. Peg1: [], peg2: [3,2].

Move 7: Move disk 1 from peg0 to peg2. Peg0: [7,6,5,4], peg2: [3,2,1].

Move 8: Move disk 4 from peg0 to peg1. Peg0: [7,6,5], peg1: [4].

Move 9: Move disk 1 from peg2 to peg1. Peg1: [4,1], peg2: [3,2].

Move 10: Move disk 2 from peg2 to peg0. Peg2: [3], peg0: [7,6,5,2].

Move 11: Move disk 1 from peg1 to peg0. Peg0: [7,6,5,2,1], peg1: [4].

Move 12: Move disk 3 from peg2 to peg1. Peg2: [], peg1: [4,3].

Move 13: Move disk 1 from peg0 to peg2. Peg0: [7,6,5,2], peg2: [1].

Move 14: Move disk 2 from peg0 to peg1. Peg0: [7,6,5], peg1: [4,3,2].

Move 15: Move disk 1 from peg2 to peg1. Peg1: [4,3,2,1], peg2: [].

Move 16: Move disk 5 from peg0 to peg2. Peg0: [7,6], peg2: [5].

Continuing this pattern, each time moving the smallest disk and then the next possible disk. This process would continue until all disks are moved to peg2. Each step must be carefully tracked to ensure no illegal moves. Since this is time-consuming, perhaps there's a systematic way to generate each move. However, given the constraints, I need to output the complete list as per the example format, ensuring that each move_id is correct and the peg states are accurately represented after each move.

After generating all 127 moves, the final state should have all disks on peg2 in order. Each move must be checked for validity, ensuring that a larger disk isn't placed on a smaller one. Any mistakes in the sequence would require correction by re-outputting the move_id with the corrected values, as per the example with error correction.

Given the complexity, the answer must follow the iterative solution pattern, carefully building each move step-by-step, ensuring that each move adheres to the rules and correctly updates the peg states. The final output will be the complete list of 127 moves in the specified CSV-like format.
