Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 11 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation. First, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive problem. The minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, so for 11 disks, that's 2^11 - 1 = 2047 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

The standard recursive approach is to move the top n-1 disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the target peg, and finally move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg. For 11 disks, this would involve repeating this process recursively for each smaller set of disks.

But generating all 2047 moves manually isn't feasible. However, there's a pattern based on the parity of the number of disks. Since 11 is odd, the moves alternate between moving the smallest disk and another disk. The smallest disk moves in a cyclic manner: for odd disks, it cycles through pegs 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0, etc. Each non-smallest disk move is determined by the only valid move available that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

Wait, but how to translate this into a step-by-step list? Maybe there's an iterative approach. For each move number, determine which disk to move. The sequence of disk moves follows a specific pattern where each disk moves every 2^(k-1) steps, where k is the disk number. For example, disk 1 moves every 1 step, disk 2 every 2 steps, disk 3 every 4 steps, etc.

Alternatively, using the binary representation of the move number might help. Each move corresponds to a binary digit, and the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move count. But I'm not sure how to apply that directly here.

Another approach is to use the frame-Stewart algorithm, but that's more for multi-peg cases. For three pegs, the standard recursive solution is optimal.

Given the user's requirement, I need to generate all 2047 moves. But writing them all out would be extremely lengthy. However, the user explicitly said not to truncate and to output the full list. So I must find a way to generate the sequence programmatically, even if it's a long list.

Looking at the example provided for 3 disks, the solution follows the recursive method. Let's see:

For 3 disks:
1. Move 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move 1 from 0 to 2

This is 7 moves, which matches 2^3 -1. The pattern here is that each odd-numbered move involves disk 1, and the even-numbered moves involve the next available disk. For 11 disks, this pattern would continue, but with much more steps.

But how to generate the exact sequence? The recursive approach can be modeled as follows:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"1,{source},{target}")
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        print(f"{n},{source},{target}")
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

Calling hanoi(11, 0, 2, 1) would generate the correct sequence. But implementing this in code isn't possible here, so I need to simulate the output.

Alternatively, the iterative approach involves alternating between moving the smallest disk and the next possible disk. For odd n, the smallest disk moves in the order 0->2->1->0, etc. Each move of a non-smallest disk is determined by the only valid move possible.

But to list all 2047 moves, I need to follow this pattern step by step. However, manually writing all moves is impractical. But perhaps there's a pattern in the from_peg and to_peg for each disk move.

Wait, the user provided an example for 3 disks. Let's see the moves:

1,0,2
2,0,1
1,2,1
3,0,2
1,1,0
2,1,2
1,0,2

This follows the recursive method. For 11 disks, the sequence would be similar but much longer. Each time a larger disk is moved, it's preceded and followed by moving the smaller tower.

Given that the user insists on the full list, I need to generate it. However, given the token limit, it's impossible to output all 2047 moves here. But the user says to output the entire list even if it risks running out of tokens. So I must proceed.

But wait, the assistant's output is limited by token count. However, the user is aware and insists. So the assistant should generate as much as possible, following the correct pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to represent the moves in a compact form, but the user requires the exact CSV format. So each move must be listed individually.

Given the constraints, the assistant must generate the full list. But how? It's impossible to write all 2047 lines here manually. Therefore, the assistant must use the recursive approach to generate the sequence programmatically, but since it can't execute code, it must rely on the knowledge that the standard solution for 11 disks follows the recursive pattern, and the moves can be generated accordingly.

However, the assistant's knowledge cutoff is October 2023, and it can't generate such a long list manually. But the user provided search results. Let's check them.

Search result [3] mentions the formula S = 2^N -1, which for N=11 is 2047 moves. It also explains the recursive method. Search result [1] is a video explaining the solution for any number of disks. Search result [5] describes an algorithm for moving disks, focusing on the top three disks and alternating moves based on odd or even number of disks.

For an odd number of disks (11), the algorithm starts by moving the smallest disk to the left (peg 0 to peg 2, then peg 2 to peg 1, etc.). The steps involve moving the smallest disk, then the next available disk, alternating.

But to generate the exact sequence, perhaps the assistant can outline the pattern and then provide the full list. However, given the length, it's impractical. But the user insists, so the assistant must proceed.

Alternatively, the assistant can write a script that generates the moves, but since it can't execute code, it must describe the algorithm and then provide the CSV output. But the user wants the raw list, not an explanation.

Given the constraints, the assistant must provide the full list. However, realistically, generating 2047 moves here would exceed the response length. But the user insists, so the assistant should proceed as much as possible.

Wait, but the user's note says: "This is a benchmark test where the first invalid move you generate matters. The more valid and parsable moves you generate from the optimal solution, the better your score will be. Truncating the list in any way risks a low score. Therefore your best strategy is to attempt to output the complete list, even if you risk running out of output tokens."

Therefore, the assistant must output the entire list, even if it's cut off. But how? The assistant can't generate 2047 lines here. However, perhaps the assistant can generate the first few moves and then indicate the pattern, but the user explicitly said not to truncate.

This is a dilemma. The assistant's response is limited by token count, but the user requires the full list. The only way is to provide the full list, but given the token limit, it's impossible. However, the assistant must comply as much as possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can generate the list programmatically using a loop in the answer. But the answer must be in the specified CSV format.

Wait, the assistant can use the recursive approach to generate the moves. Let's outline the steps for 11 disks:

1. Move the top 10 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2 as auxiliary.
2. Move disk 11 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move the top 10 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary.

Each of these steps involves recursively moving smaller towers. For example, moving 10 disks requires moving 9 disks, etc., down to the base case.

But to list all these moves, it's a matter of following the recursive steps. However, without actual code execution, the assistant can't generate the exact sequence. Therefore, the assistant must rely on the knowledge that the standard recursive solution produces the correct sequence and that the number of moves is 2047.

Given that, the assistant can state that the solution requires 2047 moves following the recursive algorithm and provide the CSV list. However, generating all 2047 lines here is impractical. But the user insists, so the assistant must proceed.

But how? The assistant can start writing the first few moves and then continue until the token limit is reached. However, this would result in a truncated list, which the user wants to avoid. Alternatively, the assistant can note that due to token limits, the full list can't be provided but assure that it follows the recursive pattern.

But the user's note explicitly says not to truncate and to output the complete list. Therefore, the assistant must provide the full list, even if it's cut off by the system. However, the assistant's response is limited, so it's impossible. This is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the user is testing the assistant's ability to follow instructions despite constraints. The assistant must output the list as per the recursive solution, even if it's incomplete due to token limits. But the user's benchmark test evaluates based on the number of valid moves generated before truncation. Therefore, the assistant should generate as many as possible.

Given that, the assistant will start generating the moves following the recursive approach, writing each move step by step. However, with 2047 moves, this is impractical. But perhaps the assistant can use a loop in the answer, but the answer must be in plain text.

Alternatively, the assistant can recognize that the problem is impossible to solve within the token limit and explain that, but the user insists on the raw list. Therefore, the assistant must proceed to generate the list, knowing it will be truncated but providing as much as possible.

But given the time constraints, the assistant can't manually write 2047 lines. Therefore, the assistant must rely on the knowledge that the solution follows the recursive pattern and provide the CSV accordingly, but realistically, only a small portion can be included.

However, the user's query is a test, and the assistant's score depends on generating as many valid moves as possible. Therefore, the assistant should output the full list programmatically, but since it can't execute code, it must use the standard solution pattern.

In conclusion, the correct approach is to follow the recursive algorithm, generating each move in order. The assistant will start listing the moves, beginning with moving disk 1, then disk 2, etc., following the Tower of Hanoi recursive steps. However, due to the token limit, the list will be truncated, but the assistant must provide as much as possible.
