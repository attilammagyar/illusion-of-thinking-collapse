Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves in the specified format without any truncation. First, I remember that the minimum number of moves required for 5 disks is 31, as per the formula 2^5 - 1. So the solution should have exactly 31 moves.

Looking at the search results, there's a PDF [1] that might have the step-by-step solution. The YouTube videos [2] and [3] probably demonstrate the moves visually, which could help verify the sequence. The Futurum Careers article [4] confirms the 31 steps for 5 disks. The Chess and Poker site [5] describes an algorithm involving moving the smallest disk and alternating between moving the next available disk.

The challenge is to translate the solution into the required format. Each move needs to specify the from_peg, to_peg, and the state of all pegs after the move. The example given for 3 disks shows how each move updates the pegs. For 5 disks, the sequence will be longer but follows a recursive pattern.

I'll start by recalling the recursive approach: move n-1 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, move the nth disk from peg 0 to peg 2, then move the n-1 disks from peg 1 to peg 2. For 5 disks, this breaks down into moving 4 disks, then the 5th, then the 4 again. Each of those 4-disk moves involves moving 3, then 4th, then 3 again, and so on.

But to get the exact move sequence, I need to refer to the provided sources. The PDF [1] lists a sequence of numbers, possibly disk numbers, but it's a bit unclear. The YouTube videos might show the actual moves, but since I can't watch them, I'll rely on the textual sources. The Chess and Poker site [5] mentions an algorithm where you alternate moving the smallest disk and the next possible disk. For odd-numbered disks, the smallest disk moves in a cyclic left direction (0->2, 2->1, 1->0, etc.), while even-numbered disks move right. Since 5 is odd, the smallest disk (1) should move left each time.

Let me try to construct the move sequence step by step, ensuring each move follows the rules and updates the pegs correctly. Starting with all disks on peg 0: [5,4,3,2,1], [], [].

Move 1: Disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Now peg0: [5,4,3,2], peg1: [], peg2: [1].

Move 2: Disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1. Peg0: [5,4,3], peg1: [2], peg2: [1].

Move 3: Disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1. Now peg1 has [2,1], peg2 is empty.

Move 4: Disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2. Peg0: [5,4], peg2: [3].

Move 5: Disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0. Peg0: [5,4,1], peg1: [2].

Move 6: Disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2. Peg2: [3,2].

Move 7: Disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Now peg2: [3,2,1].

Continuing this pattern, alternating moves of disk 1 and the next available disk. Each time a larger disk is moved, it's placed on an empty peg or a larger disk. This process continues recursively until all disks are on peg 2.

I need to ensure each move's peg states are correctly recorded. Let's verify a few more steps. After move 7, peg0 has [5,4], peg1 is empty, peg2 has [3,2,1].

Move 8: Disk 4 from peg0 to peg1. Now peg0: [5], peg1: [4], peg2: [3,2,1].

Move 9: Disk 1 from peg2 to peg1. But wait, peg1 has disk 4, which is larger, so that's allowed. Peg1 becomes [4,1].

Move 10: Disk 2 from peg2 to peg0. Peg0: [5,2], peg2: [3,1].

Wait, but disk 2 can't be placed on peg0 if there's a smaller disk. Wait, peg0 had [5], so placing 2 on top is okay because 5 is larger. So peg0 becomes [5,2].

Move 11: Disk 1 from peg1 to peg0. Now peg0: [5,2,1], peg1: [4].

Move 12: Disk 3 from peg2 to peg1. Peg1: [4,3], peg2: [].

Move 13: Disk 1 from peg0 to peg2. Peg2: [1], peg0: [5,2].

Move 14: Disk 2 from peg0 to peg1. Peg1: [4,3,2], peg0: [5].

Move 15: Disk 1 from peg2 to peg1. Peg1: [4,3,2,1].

Move 16: Disk 5 from peg0 to peg2. Now peg2 has [5], peg0 is empty.

Now, the remaining disks [4,3,2,1] need to move from peg1 to peg2. This is similar to the initial problem but with 4 disks, starting on peg1. The process repeats, but the direction of moving disk 1 changes because the number of disks is now even (4), so disk 1 moves to the right.

This alternating pattern continues, and each time a larger disk is moved, the smaller disks are shuffled accordingly. Following this method, the complete sequence of 31 moves can be generated. Each move must be checked to ensure no larger disk is placed on a smaller one, and the peg states are accurately updated after each move.

Now, translating this into the required format with move_id, from_peg, to_peg, and the peg states. Each line must reflect the state after the move. For example, the first few moves would be:

1,0,2,5 4 3 2,,1
2,0,1,5 4 3,2,1
3,2,1,5 4 3,2 1,
4,0,2,5 4,,2 1 3
...

Continuing this for all 31 moves, ensuring that each step correctly updates the pegs. Since this is a well-known solution, the exact sequence can be derived from standard Tower of Hanoi algorithms, adjusting for the 5-disk case. The provided sources, especially the PDF and the algorithm descriptions, should guide the exact move order.
