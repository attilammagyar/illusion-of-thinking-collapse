Alright, let's tackle the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 5 disks. I'll approach this step by step, making sure to follow the rules and keep track of each move.

### Understanding the Problem
We have three pegs: Peg 0, Peg 1, and Peg 2. Initially, all disks are on Peg 0, stacked from largest (5) at the bottom to smallest (1) at the top. The goal is to move all disks to Peg 2, following the rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Only the top disk of a stack can be moved.
3. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one.

### Strategy
The standard approach to the Tower of Hanoi is recursive:
- To move `n` disks from Peg A to Peg C using Peg B as auxiliary:
  1. Move `n-1` disks from Peg A to Peg B using Peg C as auxiliary.
  2. Move the nth disk (the largest one) from Peg A to Peg C.
  3. Move the `n-1` disks from Peg B to Peg C using Peg A as auxiliary.

Let's apply this to our 5-disk problem.

### Step-by-Step Moves

**Initial state:**
- Peg 0: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
- Peg 1: []
- Peg 2: []

**Move 1:** Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
- Peg 0: [5, 4, 3, 2]
- Peg 1: []
- Peg 2: [1]
Move: [1, 0, 2]

**Move 2:** Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.
- Peg 0: [5, 4, 3]
- Peg 1: [2]
- Peg 2: [1]
Move: [2, 0, 1]

**Move 3:** Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (on top of disk 2).
- Peg 0: [5, 4, 3]
- Peg 1: [2, 1]
- Peg 2: []
Move: [1, 2, 1]

**Move 4:** Move disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
- Peg 0: [5, 4]
- Peg 1: [2, 1]
- Peg 2: [3]
Move: [3, 0, 2]

**Move 5:** Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 0.
- Peg 0: [5, 4, 1]
- Peg 1: [2]
- Peg 2: [3]
Move: [1, 1, 0]

**Move 6:** Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (on top of disk 3).
- Peg 0: [5, 4, 1]
- Peg 1: []
- Peg 2: [3, 2]
Move: [2, 1, 2]

**Move 7:** Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2 (on top of disk 2).
- Peg 0: [5, 4]
- Peg 1: []
- Peg 2: [3, 2, 1]
Move: [1, 0, 2]

**Move 8:** Move disk 4 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.
- Peg 0: [5]
- Peg 1: [4]
- Peg 2: [3, 2, 1]
Move: [4, 0, 1]

**Move 9:** Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (cannot go on 4, so must go to Peg 0).
Wait, no. Disk 1 is smaller than disk 4, so it can go on Peg 1.
But Peg 1 has disk 4, and disk 1 is smaller, so it can go on top.
Wait, let's see current state:
- Peg 0: [5]
- Peg 1: [4]
- Peg 2: [3, 2, 1]
Disk 1 is on Peg 2, top of [3,2,1]. Can move to Peg 0 or Peg 1.
Peg 0 has disk 5, disk 1 is smaller, so can go there.
Peg 1 has disk 4, disk 1 is smaller, so can go there.
Let's choose Peg 0.

Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 0.
- Peg 0: [5, 1]
- Peg 1: [4]
- Peg 2: [3, 2]
Move: [1, 2, 0]

Move: [1, 0, 1]

**Move 18:** Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 2 (on top of disk 4).
