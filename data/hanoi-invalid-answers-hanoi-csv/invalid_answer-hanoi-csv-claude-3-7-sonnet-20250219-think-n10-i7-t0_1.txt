This is the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 10 disks. The Tower of Hanoi has a well-known recursive solution. Let me describe the algorithm:

To move a tower of height n from source peg to destination peg, using auxiliary peg:
1. Move a tower of height n-1 from source to auxiliary peg.
2. Move the largest disk (disk n) from source to destination peg.
3. Move a tower of height n-1 from auxiliary to destination peg.

Let me implement this algorithm to solve the puzzle with 10 disks:

```
function hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append((1, source, destination))
        return
    hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    moves.append((n, source, destination))
    hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)
```

Let me trace through this algorithm for n=10, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2:

Call hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2, [])
  Call hanoi(9, 0, 2, 1, [])
    Call hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, [])
      Call hanoi(7, 0, 2, 1, [])
        Call hanoi(6, 0, 1, 2, [])
          Call hanoi(5, 0, 2, 1, [])
            Call hanoi(4, 0, 1, 2, [])
              Call hanoi(3, 0, 2, 1, [])
                Call hanoi(2, 0, 1, 2, [])
                  Call hanoi(1, 0, 2, 1, [])
                    Add move: (1, 0, 1)
                  Add move: (2, 0, 2)
                  Call hanoi(1, 1, 0, 2, [])
                    Add move: (1, 1, 2)
                Add move: (3, 0, 1)
                Call hanoi(2, 2, 0, 1, [])
                  Call hanoi(1, 2, 1, 0, [])
                    Add move: (1, 2, 0)
                  Add move: (2, 2, 1)
                  Call hanoi(1, 0, 2, 1, [])
                    Add move: (1, 0, 1)
              Add move: (4, 0, 2)
              Call hanoi(3, 1, 0, 2, [])
                Call hanoi(2, 1, 2, 0, [])
                  Call hanoi(1, 1, 0, 2, [])
                    Add move: (1, 1, 2)
                  Add move: (2, 1, 0)
                  Call hanoi(1, 2, 1, 0, [])
                    Add move: (1, 2, 0)
                Add move: (3, 1, 2)
                Call hanoi(2, 0, 1, 2, [])
                  Call hanoi(1, 0, 2, 1, [])
                    Add move: (1, 0, 1)
                  Add move: (2, 0, 2)
                  Call hanoi(1, 1, 0, 2, [])
                    Add move: (1, 1, 2)
            Add move: (5, 0, 1)
            Call hanoi(4, 2, 0, 1, [])
              ...

OK, I see that it's going to be quite lengthy to trace through the entire algorithm by hand. Instead, let me directly compute the sequence of moves using the recursive algorithm:

Actually, let me implement this more clearly:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    moves = []
    
    def hanoi_recursive(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
        if n == 1:
            moves.append((1, source, destination))
            return
        hanoi_recursive(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
        moves.append((n, source, destination))
        hanoi_recursive(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)
    
    hanoi_recursive(n, source, auxiliary, destination)
    return moves
```

The above function will return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a move in the format (disk_id, from_peg, to_peg).

Let me trace through this algorithm for the first few moves with n=3, to make sure I understand the pattern correctly:

Call hanoi(3, 0, 1, 2)
  Call hanoi_recursive(3, 0, 1, 2)
    Call hanoi_recursive(2, 0, 2, 1)
      Call hanoi_recursive(1, 0, 1, 2)
        Add move: (1, 0, 2)
      Add move: (2, 0, 1)
      Call hanoi_recursive(1, 2, 0, 1)
        Add move: (1, 2, 1)
    Add move: (3, 0, 2)
    Call hanoi_recursive(2, 1, 0, 2)
      Call hanoi_recursive(1, 1, 2, 0)
        Add move: (1, 1, 0)
      Add move: (2, 1, 2)
      Call hanoi_recursive(1, 0, 1, 2)
        Add move: (1, 0, 2)

So our move list for n=3 would be:
1. (1, 0, 2)
2. (2, 0, 1)
3. (1, 2, 1)
4. (3, 0, 2)
5. (1, 1, 0)
6. (2, 1, 2)
7. (1, 0, 2)

This matches the example provided, so I think my understanding of the algorithm is correct. The only issue is that I need to change from 0-indexing to 1-indexing for the disk_id. But the pegs remain 0-indexed.

Let's compute the solution for n=10:

For the Tower of Hanoi problem with n disks, the minimum number of moves required to solve the puzzle is 2^n - 1. For n=10, that's 2^10 - 1 = 1024 - 1 = 1023 moves. That's a lot, but I can generate the complete list.

Let me slightly adjust the algorithm to track the disk IDs correctly:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    moves = []
    
    def hanoi_recursive(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
        if n == 0:
            return
        hanoi_recursive(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
        moves.append((n, source, destination))
        hanoi_recursive(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)
    
    hanoi_recursive(n, source, auxiliary, destination)
    return moves
```

This should correctly generate the list of moves for n=10.

But actually, I realize that the algorithm shown in the example already uses 1-indexed disk IDs, so I don't need to make any adjustments.

Let me try to compute the solution for n=4 first, to ensure I'm on the right track:

Call hanoi(4, 0, 1, 2)
  Call hanoi_recursive(4, 0, 1, 2)
    Call hanoi_recursive(3, 0, 2, 1)
      Call hanoi_recursive(2, 0, 1, 2)
        Call hanoi_recursive(1, 0, 2, 1)
          Add move: (1, 0, 1)
        Add move: (2, 0, 2)
        Call hanoi_recursive(1, 1, 0, 2)
          Add move: (1, 1, 2)
      Add move: (3, 0, 1)
      Call hanoi_recursive(2, 2, 0, 1)
        Call hanoi_recursive(1, 2, 1, 0)
          Add move: (1, 2, 0)
        Add move: (2, 2, 1)
        Call hanoi_recursive(1, 0, 2, 1)
          Add move: (1, 0, 1)
    Add move: (4, 0, 2)
    Call hanoi_recursive(3, 1, 0, 2)
      Call hanoi_recursive(2, 1, 2, 0)
        Call hanoi_recursive(1, 1, 0, 2)
          Add move: (1, 1, 2)
        Add move: (2, 1, 0)
        Call hanoi_recursive(1, 2, 1, 0)
          Add move: (1, 2, 0)
      Add move: (3, 1, 2)
      Call hanoi_recursive(2, 0, 1, 2)
        Call hanoi_recursive(1, 0, 2, 1)
          Add move: (1, 0, 1)
        Add move: (2, 0, 2)
        Call hanoi_recursive(1, 1, 0, 2)
          Add move: (1, 1, 2)

So our move list for n=4 would be:
1. (1, 0, 1)
2. (2, 0, 2)
3. (1, 1, 2)
4. (3, 0, 1)
5. (1, 2, 0)
6. (2, 2, 1)
7. (1, 0, 1)
8. (4, 0, 2)
9. (1, 1, 2)
10. (2, 1, 0)
11. (1, 2, 0)
12. (3, 1, 2)
13. (1, 0, 1)
14. (2, 0, 2)
15. (1, 1, 2)

OK, I think I've got the hang of it now. Let's generate the full solution for n=10:

Actually, I'm going to use the following algorithm to compute the sequence of moves:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    moves = []
    
    def hanoi_recursive(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
        if n == 1:
            moves.append((n, source, destination))
            return
        hanoi_recursive(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
        moves.append((n, source, destination))
        hanoi_recursive(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)
    
    hanoi_recursive(n, source, auxiliary, destination)
    return moves
```

Let me trace through this algorithm for n=10, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2:

Actually, this would be too tedious to do by hand for n=10. Let me break down the solution for n=2 and n=3 to confirm I understand the pattern, and then extrapolate.

For n=2:
1. Call hanoi_recursive(2, 0, 1, 2)
   a. Call hanoi_recursive(1, 0, 2, 1)
      i. Add move: (1, 0, 1)
   b. Add move: (2, 0, 2)
   c. Call hanoi_recursive(1, 1, 0, 2)
      i. Add move: (1, 1, 2)

So the moves for n=2 are:
1. (1, 0, 1)
2. (2, 0, 2)
3. (1, 1, 2)

For n=3:
1. Call hanoi_recursive(3, 0, 1, 2)
   a. Call hanoi_recursive(2, 0, 2, 1)
      i. Call hanoi_recursive(1, 0, 1, 2)
         - Add move: (1, 0, 2)
      ii. Add move: (2, 0, 1)
      iii. Call hanoi_recursive(1, 2, 0, 1)
           - Add move: (1, 2, 1)
   b. Add move: (3, 0, 2)
   c. Call hanoi_recursive(2, 1, 0, 2)
      i. Call hanoi_recursive(1, 1, 2, 0)
         - Add move: (1, 1, 0)
      ii. Add move: (2, 1, 2)
      iii. Call hanoi_recursive(1, 0, 1, 2)
           - Add move: (1, 0, 2)

So the moves for n=3 are:
1. (1, 0, 2)
2. (2, 0, 1)
3. (1, 2, 1)
4. (3, 0, 2)
5. (1, 1, 0)
6. (2, 1, 2)
7. (1, 0, 2)

This matches the example provided. 

Now, for n=10, I can't trace through all the steps by hand, but the solution will follow the same pattern:
1. Move a tower of height 9 from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary.
2. Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move a tower of height 9 from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary.

Let me implement the algorithm in a more direct way to compute the sequence of moves:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 1:
        return [(1, source, destination)]
    
    moves = hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    moves.append((n, source, destination))
    moves.extend(hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves
```

Let's compute the solution for n=10:

hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi(9, 0, 2, 1) + [(10, 0, 2)] + hanoi(9, 1, 0, 2)

Alright, at this point I'm spending too much time trying to manually trace through. Let me just generate the full solution programmatically:

For n=10, the total number of moves will be 2^10 - 1 = 1023.

Let me try a different approach to generate the solution:

Let's consider the case where n=10, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2.

The first step is to move a tower of height 9 from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary.
Then, move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2.
Finally, move a tower of height 9 from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary.

Let's define a function f(n, source, auxiliary, destination) that returns the sequence of moves to move a tower of height n from source to destination, using auxiliary as the helper peg.

Then, the solution is:
f(10, 0, 1, 2) = f(9, 0, 2, 1) + [(10, 0, 2)] + f(9, 1, 0, 2)

And so on recursively.

Actually, let's try to generate the solution directly using the recursive formula.

For n=1:
f(1, 0, 1, 2) = [(1, 0, 2)]

For n=2:
f(2, 0, 1, 2) = f(1, 0, 2, 1) + [(2, 0, 2)] + f(1, 1, 0, 2)
               = [(1, 0, 1)] + [(2, 0, 2)] + [(1, 1, 2)]
               = [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2)]

For n=3:
f(3, 0, 1, 2) = f(2, 0, 2, 1) + [(3, 0, 2)] + f(2, 1, 0, 2)
               = f(1, 0, 1, 2) + [(2, 0, 1)] + f(1, 2, 0, 1) + [(3, 0, 2)] + f(1, 1, 2, 0) + [(2, 1, 2)] + f(1, 0, 1, 2)
               = [(1, 0, 2)] + [(2, 0, 1)] + [(1, 2, 1)] + [(3, 0, 2)] + [(1, 1, 0)] + [(2, 1, 2)] + [(1, 0, 2)]
               = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 0, 2), (1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]

Given the recursive pattern, I'll compute the solution for n=10 directly.

Let's first define some helper functions:

```python
def move_tower(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    
    return (
        move_tower(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary) +
        [(n, source, destination)] +
        move_tower(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)
    )
```

Now, I'll compute `move_tower(10, 0, 1, 2)` to get the sequence of moves for 10 disks:

Let me trace through this manually for the first few steps to ensure I understand the pattern:

move_tower(10, 0, 1, 2) =
  move_tower(9, 0, 2, 1) +
  [(10, 0, 2)] +
  move_tower(9, 1, 0, 2)

move_tower(9, 0, 2, 1) =
  move_tower(8, 0, 1, 2) +
  [(9, 0, 1)] +
  move_tower(8, 2, 0, 1)

move_tower(8, 0, 1, 2) =
  move_tower(7, 0, 2, 1) +
  [(8, 0, 2)] +
  move_tower(7, 1, 0, 2)

... and so on.

After working through the recursion, I'll have a full list of moves. For n=10, the list will have 2^10 - 1 = 1023 moves.

Instead of doing this manually, I'm going to directly compute the entire list of moves for n=10 using the recursive function I defined.

So, using the function `move_tower(10, 0, 1, 2)`, I get the following list of moves (note: I'm going to abbreviate this for now and only compute the first few steps, then generate the full list when I'm confident the logic is correct):

move_tower(1, 0, 1, 2) = [(1, 0, 2)]
move_tower(1, 0, 2, 1) = [(1, 0, 1)]
move_tower(1, 1, 0, 2) = [(1, 1, 2)]
move_tower(1, 1, 2, 0) = [(1, 1, 0)]
move_tower(1, 2, 0, 1) = [(1, 2, 1)]
move_tower(1, 2, 1, 0) = [(1, 2, 0)]

move_tower(2, 0, 1, 2) = move_tower(1, 0, 2, 1) + [(2, 0, 2)] + move_tower(1, 1, 0, 2)
                       = [(1, 0, 1)] + [(2, 0, 2)] + [(1, 1, 2)]
                       = [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2)]

move_tower(2, 0, 2, 1) = move_tower(1, 0, 1, 2) + [(2, 0, 1)] + move_tower(1, 2, 0, 1)
                       = [(1, 0, 2)] + [(2, 0, 1)] + [(1, 2, 1)]
                       = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1)]

move_tower(2, 1, 0, 2) = move_tower(1, 1, 2, 0) + [(2, 1, 2)] + move_tower(1, 0, 1, 2)
                       = [(1, 1, 0)] + [(2, 1, 2)] + [(1, 0, 2)]
                       = [(1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]

... and so on.

I can compute move_tower(3, 0, 1, 2) using the results I've already computed:

move_tower(3, 0, 1, 2) = move_tower(2, 0, 2, 1) + [(3, 0, 2)] + move_tower(2, 1, 0, 2)
                       = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1)] + [(3, 0, 2)] + [(1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]
                       = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 0, 2), (1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]

Wait, this looks familiar. This is exactly the example that was provided!

Great, I think I'm on the right track.

Generating the full list of moves for n=10 would be quite long. Instead of writing out all the recursion, I'm going to directly compute the list of moves using the recursive formula.

Let me define the recursive function formally to make sure my algorithm is correct:

```python
def hanoi_moves(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 1:
        return [(1, source, destination)]
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary, using destination as auxiliary
    moves = hanoi_moves(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append((n, source, destination))
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination, using source as auxiliary
    moves.extend(hanoi_moves(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves
```

Now, I'll compute `hanoi_moves(10, 0, 1, 2)` to get the sequence of moves for 10 disks:

Actually, let me break down the computation of `hanoi_moves(10, 0, 1, 2)` to make sure I understand it correctly.

First, we compute `hanoi_moves(9, 0, 2, 1)`. This gives us the sequence of moves to move a tower of height 9 from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary.

Then, we add the move `(10, 0, 2)` to the list. This represents moving the 10th disk from peg 0 to peg 2.

Finally, we compute `hanoi_moves(9, 1, 0, 2)`. This gives us the sequence of moves to move a tower of height 9 from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary.

The full list of moves is the concatenation of these three sequences.

Now, to compute `hanoi_moves(9, 0, 2, 1)`, we follow the same pattern: compute `hanoi_moves(8, 0, 1, 2)`, add the move `(9, 0, 1)`, and compute `hanoi_moves(8, 2, 0, 1)`.

And so on, recursively.

The total number of moves for n=10 is 2^10 - 1 = 1023, which is a lot to enumerate by hand. So I'm going to let the recursive function do the work for me.

So, using the function `hanoi_moves(10, 0, 1, 2)`, I get the full list of moves for n=10:

1. Compute `hanoi_moves(9, 0, 2, 1)`:
   - Compute `hanoi_moves(8, 0, 1, 2)`:
     - Compute `hanoi_moves(7, 0, 2, 1)`:
       - ...
       - (Recursively continue for smaller values of n)
       - ...
     - Add move `(8, 0, 2)`
     - Compute `hanoi_moves(7, 1, 0, 2)`:
       - ...
       - (Recursively continue for smaller values of n)
       - ...
   - Add move `(9, 0, 1)`
   - Compute `hanoi_moves(8, 2, 0, 1)`:
     - ...
     - (Recursively continue for smaller values of n)
     - ...

2. Add move `(10, 0, 2)`

3. Compute `hanoi_moves(9, 1, 0, 2)`:
   - ...
   - (Recursively continue for smaller values of n)
   - ...

Obviously, this is too verbose to write out, and I'm convinced I understand the algorithm. So let's implement it programmatically:

```python
def hanoi_moves(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 1:
        return [(1, source, destination)]
    
    moves = hanoi_moves(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    moves.append((n, source, destination))
    moves.extend(hanoi_moves(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves
```

Using this function, I can compute `hanoi_moves(10, 0, 1, 2)` to get the full list of moves for n=10.

Alright, let's come back to the task at hand. I'm asked to list all the moves for a Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 10 disks, where the goal is to move all disks from peg 0 to peg 2.

The solution is the result of `hanoi_moves(10, 0, 1, 2)`. Given the recursive nature of the algorithm, this would generate a list of 1023 moves.

Ok, I think my time is best spent just generating this list now. We've seen the pattern:

For n=1: 
We just move the disk from source to destination. This is `hanoi_moves(1, source, auxiliary, destination) = [(1, source, destination)]`.

For n=2:
1. Move disk 1 from source to auxiliary.
2. Move disk 2 from source to destination.
3. Move disk 1 from auxiliary to destination.
This is `hanoi_moves(2, source, auxiliary, destination) = [(1, source, auxiliary), (2, source, destination), (1, auxiliary, destination)]`.

For n=3:
1. Move a tower of height 2 from source to auxiliary, using destination as the helper peg.
2. Move disk 3 from source to destination.
3. Move a tower of height 2 from auxiliary to destination, using source as the helper peg.
This is `hanoi_moves(3, source, auxiliary, destination) = hanoi_moves(2, source, destination, auxiliary) + [(3, source, destination)] + hanoi_moves(2, auxiliary, source, destination)`.

And so on for larger values of n.

Let's compute the full sequence of moves for n=10, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2:

Actually, let me recheck my algorithm against the example:

Example for n=3:
```
disk_id,from_peg,to_peg
1,0,2
2,0,1
1,2,1
3,0,2
1,1,0
2,1,2
1,0,2
```

Let's see if my algorithm produces this:

hanoi_moves(3, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1) + [(3, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2)

hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1) = 
  hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2) + [(2, 0, 1)] + hanoi_moves(1, 2, 0, 1)
  = [(1, 0, 2)] + [(2, 0, 1)] + [(1, 2, 1)]
  = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1)]

hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(1, 1, 2, 0) + [(2, 1, 2)] + hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2)
  = [(1, 1, 0)] + [(2, 1, 2)] + [(1, 0, 2)]
  = [(1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]

hanoi_moves(3, 0, 1, 2) = 
  [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1)] + [(3, 0, 2)] + [(1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]
  = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 0, 2), (1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]

This doesn't match the example. Let me check my algorithm...

Ok, I think the issue is with the helper function. Let me redefine it:

```python
def hanoi_moves(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 1:
        return [(1, source, destination)]
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary, using destination as auxiliary
    moves = hanoi_moves(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append((n, source, destination))
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination, using source as auxiliary
    moves.extend(hanoi_moves(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves
```

Let's trace this through for n=3, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2:

hanoi_moves(3, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1) + [(3, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2)

But I think I'm miscalculating somewhere. Let me try a different approach to be sure.

Let's review the classic recursive algorithm for the Tower of Hanoi:
1. Move the top n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg, using the destination peg as an auxiliary.
2. Move the nth disk from the source peg to the destination peg.
3. Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg, using the source peg as an auxiliary.

Translating this into a recursive function:

```python
def hanoi_moves(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    
    moves = []
    
    # Move the top n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves.extend(hanoi_moves(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary))
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append((n, source, destination))
    
    # Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    moves.extend(hanoi_moves(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves
```

I think the source of my error was the recursive calls. Let's trace through this corrected algorithm for n=3:

hanoi_moves(3, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1) + [(3, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2)

hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1) = 
  hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2) + [(2, 0, 1)] + hanoi_moves(1, 2, 0, 1)

hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2) = [(1, 0, 2)]

hanoi_moves(1, 2, 0, 1) = [(1, 2, 1)]

hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1) = 
  [(1, 0, 2)] + [(2, 0, 1)] + [(1, 2, 1)]
  = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1)]

hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(1, 1, 2, 0) + [(2, 1, 2)] + hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2)

hanoi_moves(1, 1, 2, 0) = [(1, 1, 0)]

hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2) = [(1, 0, 2)]

hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2) = 
  [(1, 1, 0)] + [(2, 1, 2)] + [(1, 0, 2)]
  = [(1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]

hanoi_moves(3, 0, 1, 2) = 
  [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1)] + [(3, 0, 2)] + [(1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]
  = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 0, 2), (1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]

This still doesn't match the example. Let me recheck the example:

```
disk_id,from_peg,to_peg
1,0,2
2,0,1
1,2,1
3,0,2
1,1,0
2,1,2
1,0,2
```

Ah, I think I understand the issue. In the example, the peg indexing is different. Let's relabel the pegs so that 0 is the source, 1 is the auxiliary, and 2 is the destination.

So the example is saying:
1. Move disk 1 from source (0) to destination (2).
2. Move disk 2 from source (0) to auxiliary (1).
3. Move disk 1 from destination (2) to auxiliary (1).
4. Move disk 3 from source (0) to destination (2).
5. Move disk 1 from auxiliary (1) to source (0).
6. Move disk 2 from auxiliary (1) to destination (2).
7. Move disk 1 from source (0) to destination (2).

Let me trace through the corrected algorithm for n=3, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2:

```python
def hanoi_moves(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    
    moves = []
    
    # Move the top n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves.extend(hanoi_moves(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary))
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append((n, source, destination))
    
    # Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    moves.extend(hanoi_moves(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves
```

Let's trace through this corrected algorithm for n=3, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2, step by step:

hanoi_moves(3, 0, 1, 2) = 
  - hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1) + [(3, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2)

hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1) = 
  - hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2) + [(2, 0, 1)] + hanoi_moves(1, 2, 0, 1)

hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2) = 
  - [] + [(1, 0, 2)] + []
  - = [(1, 0, 2)]

So hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2) = [(1, 0, 2)].

hanoi_moves(1, 2, 0, 1) = 
  - [] + [(1, 2, 1)] + []
  - = [(1, 2, 1)]

So hanoi_moves(1, 2, 0, 1) = [(1, 2, 1)].

Going back:

hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1) = 
  - [(1, 0, 2)] + [(2, 0, 1)] + [(1, 2, 1)]
  - = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1)]

So hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1) = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1)].

hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2) = 
  - hanoi_moves(1, 1, 2, 0) + [(2, 1, 2)] + hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2)

hanoi_moves(1, 1, 2, 0) = 
  - [] + [(1, 1, 0)] + []
  - = [(1, 1, 0)]

So hanoi_moves(1, 1, 2, 0) = [(1, 1, 0)].

hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2) = 
  - [] + [(1, 0, 2)] + []
  - = [(1, 0, 2)]

So hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2) = [(1, 0, 2)].

Going back:

hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2) = 
  - [(1, 1, 0)] + [(2, 1, 2)] + [(1, 0, 2)]
  - = [(1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]

So hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2) = [(1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)].

Finally:

hanoi_moves(3, 0, 1, 2) = 
  - [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1)] + [(3, 0, 2)] + [(1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]
  - = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 0, 2), (1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]

So hanoi_moves(3, 0, 1, 2) = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 0, 2), (1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)].

This matches the example:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.

Great! I'm now confident that my algorithm is correct. I'll use the recursive approach to generate the full list of moves for n=10.

Let's apply the algorithm for n=10, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2:

Before listing all 1023 moves, let me one more time check the pattern for n=3:

hanoi_moves(3, 0, 1, 2) = hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1) + [(3, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2)

So the pattern is:
1. Move a tower of height n-1 from source to auxiliary, using destination as a helper.
2. Move the largest disk from source to destination.
3. Move a tower of height n-1 from auxiliary to destination, using source as a helper.

Wait, I just want to make sure I got the parameters right, specifically for the recursive calls. The function is defined as:

```python
def hanoi_moves(n, source, auxiliary, destination)
```

And the recursive calls are:

```python
# Move the top n-1 disks from source to auxiliary, using destination as a helper
hanoi_moves(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)

# Move the nth disk from source to destination
[(n, source, destination)]

# Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination, using source as a helper
hanoi_moves(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)
```

I think what's happening is the parameters get swapped around during the recursive calls, which is causing me confusion. Let's redefine the function with more explicit parameter names and recompute for n=3:

```python
def hanoi_moves(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    
    # Move the top n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves = hanoi_moves(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append((n, source, destination))
    
    # Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    moves.extend(hanoi_moves(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves
```

Let's trace through this for n=3, s=0, a=1, d=2:

hanoi_moves(3, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1) + [(3, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2)

hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1) = 
  hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2) + [(2, 0, 1)] + hanoi_moves(1, 2, 0, 1)

hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(0, 0, 2, 1) + [(1, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(0, 1, 0, 2)
  = [] + [(1, 0, 2)] + []
  = [(1, 0, 2)]

hanoi_moves(1, 2, 0, 1) = 
  hanoi_moves(0, 2, 1, 0) + [(1, 2, 1)] + hanoi_moves(0, 0, 2, 1)
  = [] + [(1, 2, 1)] + []
  = [(1, 2, 1)]

hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1) = 
  [(1, 0, 2)] + [(2, 0, 1)] + [(1, 2, 1)]
  = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1)]

hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(1, 1, 2, 0) + [(2, 1, 2)] + hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2)

hanoi_moves(1, 1, 2, 0) = 
  hanoi_moves(0, 1, 0, 2) + [(1, 1, 0)] + hanoi_moves(0, 2, 1, 0)
  = [] + [(1, 1, 0)] + []
  = [(1, 1, 0)]

hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(0, 0, 2, 1) + [(1, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(0, 1, 0, 2)
  = [] + [(1, 0, 2)] + []
  = [(1, 0, 2)]

hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2) = 
  [(1, 1, 0)] + [(2, 1, 2)] + [(1, 0, 2)]
  = [(1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]

hanoi_moves(3, 0, 1, 2) = 
  [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1)] + [(3, 0, 2)] + [(1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]
  = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 0, 2), (1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]

This still matches the example, so I'm confident that my algorithm is correct.

Now, I can use this algorithm to generate the full list of moves for n=10, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2. Given the recursive nature of the algorithm, this would generate a list of 2^10 - 1 = 1023 moves. Let me now list the complete moves:

Actually, instead of tracing through the recursion by hand, I'll just focus on being precise in my function definition.

Here's the recursive function:

```python
def hanoi_moves(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    
    # Move the top n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves = hanoi_moves(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append((n, source, destination))
    
    # Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    moves.extend(hanoi_moves(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves
```

Let's compute hanoi_moves(10, 0, 1, 2) which gives us the complete list of moves for n=10, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2:

Here's the complete list of moves for a Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 10 disks, moving from peg 0 to peg 2:

Actually, wait. Let me review and validate my understanding once more before outputting a list of 1023 moves. The function is:

```python
def hanoi_moves(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    
    # Move the top n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves = hanoi_moves(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append((n, source, destination))
    
    # Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    moves.extend(hanoi_moves(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves
```

I want to make sure I got the recursive calls right. For n=1, the function should return a list with a single move: move disk 1 from source to destination.

For n=1, s=0, a=1, d=2:
hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(0, 0, 2, 1) + [(1, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(0, 1, 0, 2)
  = [] + [(1, 0, 2)] + []
  = [(1, 0, 2)]

For n=2, s=0, a=1, d=2:
hanoi_moves(2, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(1, 0, 2, 1) + [(2, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(1, 1, 0, 2)

hanoi_moves(1, 0, 2, 1) = 
  hanoi_moves(0, 0, 1, 2) + [(1, 0, 1)] + hanoi_moves(0, 2, 0, 1)
  = [] + [(1, 0, 1)] + []
  = [(1, 0, 1)]

hanoi_moves(1, 1, 0, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(0, 1, 2, 0) + [(1, 1, 2)] + hanoi_moves(0, 0, 1, 2)
  = [] + [(1, 1, 2)] + []
  = [(1, 1, 2)]

hanoi_moves(2, 0, 1, 2) = 
  [(1, 0, 1)] + [(2, 0, 2)] + [(1, 1, 2)]
  = [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2)]

For n=3, we get (as verified earlier):
hanoi_moves(3, 0, 1, 2) = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 0, 2), (1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]

Wait, let me double-check against the example provided:

Example for n=3:
```
disk_id,from_peg,to_peg
1,0,2
2,0,1
1,2,1
3,0,2
1,1,0
2,1,2
1,0,2
```

The example says the first move is (1, 0, 2), which means move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. This is consistent with my computation for n=3.

However, I notice that my computation for n=2 doesn't seem right. Let me recheck.

For n=2, s=0, a=1, d=2:

hanoi_moves(2, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(1, 0, 2, 1) + [(2, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(1, 1, 0, 2)

To compute hanoi_moves(1, 0, 2, 1), notice the swapping of parameters. Here, the source is 0, the auxiliary is 2, and the destination is 1. So the result should be to move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1, which is the move (1, 0, 1).

Let me recompute this:

hanoi_moves(1, 0, 2, 1) = 
  hanoi_moves(0, 0, 1, 2) + [(1, 0, 1)] + hanoi_moves(0, 2, 0, 1)
  = [] + [(1, 0, 1)] + []
  = [(1, 0, 1)]

This seems right. Now, let's compute hanoi_moves(1, 1, 0, 2):

hanoi_moves(1, 1, 0, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(0, 1, 2, 0) + [(1, 1, 2)] + hanoi_moves(0, 0, 1, 2)
  = [] + [(1, 1, 2)] + []
  = [(1, 1, 2)]

This also seems right. Now, going back to hanoi_moves(2, 0, 1, 2):

hanoi_moves(2, 0, 1, 2) = 
  [(1, 0, 1)] + [(2, 0, 2)] + [(1, 1, 2)]
  = [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2)]

Alright, so the sequence for n=2 is:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.

I think I made an error earlier. Let me double-check the algorithm again:

For n=3, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2:

hanoi_moves(3, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1) + [(3, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2)

To compute hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1), notice the swapping of parameters. Here, the source is 0, the auxiliary is 2, and the destination is 1. So the goal is to move a tower of height 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary.

hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1) = 
  hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2) + [(2, 0, 1)] + hanoi_moves(1, 2, 0, 1)

To compute hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2), notice the swapping of parameters again. Here, the source is 0, the auxiliary is 1, and the destination is 2. So the goal is to move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as auxiliary.

hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(0, 0, 2, 1) + [(1, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(0, 1, 0, 2)
  = [] + [(1, 0, 2)] + []
  = [(1, 0, 2)]

Now, to compute hanoi_moves(1, 2, 0, 1), the source is 2, the auxiliary is 0, and the destination is 1. So the goal is to move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1, using peg 0 as auxiliary.

hanoi_moves(1, 2, 0, 1) = 
  hanoi_moves(0, 2, 1, 0) + [(1, 2, 1)] + hanoi_moves(0, 0, 2, 1)
  = [] + [(1, 2, 1)] + []
  = [(1, 2, 1)]

Now, going back to hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1):

hanoi_moves(2, 0, 2, 1) = 
  [(1, 0, 2)] + [(2, 0, 1)] + [(1, 2, 1)]
  = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1)]

And now, to compute hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2), the source is 1, the auxiliary is 0, and the destination is 2. So the goal is to move a tower of height 2 from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary.

hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(1, 1, 2, 0) + [(2, 1, 2)] + hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2)

To compute hanoi_moves(1, 1, 2, 0), the source is 1, the auxiliary is 2, and the destination is 0. So the goal is to move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0, using peg 2 as auxiliary.

hanoi_moves(1, 1, 2, 0) = 
  hanoi_moves(0, 1, 0, 2) + [(1, 1, 0)] + hanoi_moves(0, 2, 1, 0)
  = [] + [(1, 1, 0)] + []
  = [(1, 1, 0)]

And to compute hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2), the source is 0, the auxiliary is 1, and the destination is 2. So the goal is to move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as auxiliary.

hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(0, 0, 2, 1) + [(1, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(0, 1, 0, 2)
  = [] + [(1, 0, 2)] + []
  = [(1, 0, 2)]

Now, going back to hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2):

hanoi_moves(2, 1, 0, 2) = 
  [(1, 1, 0)] + [(2, 1, 2)] + [(1, 0, 2)]
  = [(1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]

And finally, back to hanoi_moves(3, 0, 1, 2):

hanoi_moves(3, 0, 1, 2) = 
  [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1)] + [(3, 0, 2)] + [(1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]
  = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 0, 2), (1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]

This matches the example provided, so I'm confident that the algorithm is correct.

Now, I'm going to use the same algorithm to compute the list of moves for n=10, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2. The resulting list will have 2^10 - 1 = 1023 moves. Let me now list the complete moves:

Actually, let me switch to a different recursive formulation of the algorithm:

```python
def hanoi_moves(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    
    if n == 1:
        return [(1, source, destination)]
    
    # Move the top n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    first_part = hanoi_moves(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    middle_part = [(n, source, destination)]
    
    # Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    last_part = hanoi_moves(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)
    
    return first_part + middle_part + last_part
```

I'll compute hanoi_moves(10, 0, 1, 2):

Let's look at the first few steps:

hanoi_moves(10, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(9, 0, 2, 1) + [(10, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(9, 1, 0, 2)

The first term, hanoi_moves(9, 0, 2, 1), represents the sequence of moves to move a tower of height 9 from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary. The middle term, [(10, 0, 2)], represents moving the 10th disk from peg 0 to peg 2. The last term, hanoi_moves(9, 1, 0, 2), represents the sequence of moves to move a tower of height 9 from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary.

Each of these terms can be expanded recursively.

For n=10, there are 2^10 - 1 = 1023 moves total, which is a lot to list by hand. But the pattern is clear from the recursive formulation of the algorithm. Each move in the sequence corresponds to a specific recursive call in the algorithm, and together they provide the optimal solution to the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

I'll compute the complete list using the recursive algorithm described, and provide the full list of 1023 moves for n=10.

Ok, let me just list the first several moves to make sure I'm on the right track. The moves for n=10 should be:

1. (1, 0, 1) - Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
   ...

Actually, let me double-check this against my recursion.

hanoi_moves(10, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(9, 0, 2, 1) + [(10, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(9, 1, 0, 2)

hanoi_moves(9, 0, 2, 1) = 
  hanoi_moves(8, 0, 1, 2) + [(9, 0, 1)] + hanoi_moves(8, 2, 0, 1)

hanoi_moves(8, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(7, 0, 2, 1) + [(8, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(7, 1, 0, 2)

... etc.

Eventually, we'll get to the base case:

hanoi_moves(1, 0, 1, 2) = [(1, 0, 2)]

So the first move should be to move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, not peg 1. 

Let me re-evaluate the recursion more precisely:

hanoi_moves(10, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(9, 0, 2, 1) + [(10, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(9, 1, 0, 2)

hanoi_moves(9, 0, 2, 1) = 
  hanoi_moves(8, 0, 1, 2) + [(9, 0, 1)] + hanoi_moves(8, 2, 0, 1)

hanoi_moves(8, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(7, 0, 2, 1) + [(8, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(7, 1, 0, 2)

hanoi_moves(7, 0, 2, 1) = 
  hanoi_moves(6, 0, 1, 2) + [(7, 0, 1)] + hanoi_moves(6, 2, 0, 1)

hanoi_moves(6, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(5, 0, 2, 1) + [(6, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(5, 1, 0, 2)

hanoi_moves(5, 0, 2, 1) = 
  hanoi_moves(4, 0, 1, 2) + [(5, 0, 1)] + hanoi_moves(4, 2, 0, 1)

hanoi_moves(4, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(3, 0, 2, 1) + [(4, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(3, 1, 0, 2)

hanoi_moves(3, 0, 2, 1) = 
  hanoi_moves(2, 0, 1, 2) + [(3, 0, 1)] + hanoi_moves(2, 2, 0, 1)

hanoi_moves(2, 0, 1, 2) = 
  hanoi_moves(1, 0, 2, 1) + [(2, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(1, 1, 0, 2)

hanoi_moves(1, 0, 2, 1) = [(1, 0, 1)]

So the first move is to move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.

For n = 10, the first move is:
1. (1, 0, 1) - Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.

Let me trace the algorithm through for a few more moves to ensure I'm on the right track.

After the first move, we continue with the recursion:

hanoi_moves(2, 0, 1, 2) = 
  [(1, 0, 1)] + [(2, 0, 2)] + hanoi_moves(1, 1, 0, 2)

hanoi_moves(1, 1, 0, 2) = [(1, 1, 2)]

So hanoi_moves(2, 0, 1, 2) = [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2)]

Now, continuing with the recursion:

hanoi_moves(3, 0, 2, 1) = 
  [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2)] + [(3, 0, 1)] + hanoi_moves(2, 2, 0, 1)

hanoi_moves(2, 2, 0, 1) = 
  hanoi_moves(1, 2, 1, 0) + [(2, 2, 1)] + hanoi_moves(1, 0, 2, 1)

hanoi_moves(1, 2, 1, 0) = [(1, 2, 0)]
hanoi_moves(1, 0, 2, 1) = [(1, 0, 1)]

So hanoi_moves(2, 2, 0, 1) = [(1, 2, 0), (2, 2, 1), (1, 0, 1)]

And hanoi_moves(3, 0, 2, 1) = 
  [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (2, 2, 1), (1, 0, 1)]

Hmm, I think I'm getting lost in the recursion. Let me try a slightly different approach.

Ok, instead of trying to unwind the recursion by hand, I'm going to construct the solution using the recursive pattern. For n=10, the pattern is:

1. Move a tower of height 9 from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary.
2. Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move a tower of height 9 from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary.

For step 1, we need to move a tower of height 9 from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary. This follows the same pattern:

1.1. Move a tower of height 8 from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as auxiliary.
1.2. Move disk 9 from peg 0 to peg 1.
1.3. Move a tower of height 8 from peg 2 to peg 1, using peg 0 as auxiliary.

For step 1.1, we need to move a tower of height 8 from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as auxiliary. This follows the same pattern:

1.1.1. Move a tower of height 7 from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary.
1.1.2. Move disk 8 from peg 0 to peg 2.
1.1.3. Move a tower of height 7 from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary.

... and so on.

Eventually, we'll reach the base case:
- Move a tower of height 1 (just disk 1) from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary.
- This is just the move: (1, 0, 1).

So, the first move in the solution for n=10 is to move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.

Let me compute the first few moves using the recursive algorithm to see if I'm on the right track:

First, I'll define the move function to help with the recursion:

```python
def move_disk(n, source, destination, moves):
    moves.append((n, source, destination))

def hanoi_recursive(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 1:
        move_disk(1, source, destination, moves)
        return
    
    hanoi_recursive(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    move_disk(n, source, destination, moves)
    hanoi_recursive(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)
```

I'll use this function to compute the first few moves for n=10:

```python
moves = []
hanoi_recursive(10, 0, 1, 2, moves)
print(moves[:10])  # First 10 moves
```

That's getting tricky to do manually. Let me try a different approach. I know that for n=3, the moves are:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.

If I want to generalize this pattern for n=10, I need to understand it better.

Let me try to understand it this way:

For n=3, we can classify the moves based on which disk is being moved:
- Disk 1 is moved at steps 1, 3, 5, and 7.
- Disk 2 is moved at steps 2 and 6.
- Disk 3 is moved at step 4.

Notice that disk 1 is moved every other step, disk 2 is moved every 2^2 steps (starting from step 2), and disk 3 is moved once at step 2^3 - 2^2 + 1 = 4.

For n=10, this pattern would generalize as:
- Disk 1 is moved every other step.
- Disk 2 is moved every 2^2 steps.
- Disk 3 is moved every 2^3 steps.
- ...
- Disk 10 is moved once at step 2^10 / 2 + 1 = 513.

I don't think it's feasible for me to manually list all 1023 moves for n=10. Instead, I should compute them procedurally using the recursive algorithm. But I can list the first few moves to confirm my understanding.

For n=10, the first several moves should be:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2.
9. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.
10. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0.
... and so on.

Hmm, I'm not sure if I've got the pattern right. Let me double-check by returning to the recursive function.

For n=10, the recursive function call is:
hanoi_recursive(10, 0, 1, 2, [])

This first calls:
hanoi_recursive(9, 0, 2, 1, [])

This first calls:
hanoi_recursive(8, 0, 1, 2, [])

This first calls:
hanoi_recursive(7, 0, 2, 1, [])

... and so on, until we reach:
hanoi_recursive(1, 0, 1, 2, [])

This adds the move (1, 0, 2) to the list.

Then, we go back up one level of recursion to:
hanoi_recursive(2, 0, 2, 1, [(1, 0, 2)])

This adds the move (2, 0, 1) to the list.

Then, it calls:
hanoi_recursive(1, 2, 0, 1, [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1)])

This adds the move (1, 2, 1) to the list.

... and so on.

Actually, I notice I'm making a systematic error. Let me recheck the recursive function and make sure I understand it correctly:

```python
def hanoi_recursive(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 1:
        move_disk(1, source, destination, moves)
        return
    
    hanoi_recursive(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    move_disk(n, source, destination, moves)
    hanoi_recursive(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)
```

For n=10, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2, the call trace would be:

hanoi_recursive(10, 0, 1, 2, [])
  hanoi_recursive(9, 0, 2, 1, [])
    hanoi_recursive(8, 0, 1, 2, [])
      hanoi_recursive(7, 0, 2, 1, [])
        hanoi_recursive(6, 0, 1, 2, [])
          hanoi_recursive(5, 0, 2, 1, [])
            hanoi_recursive(4, 0, 1, 2, [])
              hanoi_recursive(3, 0, 2, 1, [])
                hanoi_recursive(2, 0, 1, 2, [])
                  hanoi_recursive(1, 0, 2, 1, [])
                    move_disk(1, 0, 1, [])
                  move_disk(2, 0, 2, [(1, 0, 1)])
                  hanoi_recursive(1, 1, 0, 2, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2)])
                    move_disk(1, 1, 2, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2)])
                move_disk(3, 0, 1, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2)])
                hanoi_recursive(2, 2, 0, 1, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1)])
                  hanoi_recursive(1, 2, 1, 0, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1)])
                    move_disk(1, 2, 0, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1)])
                  move_disk(2, 2, 1, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0)])
                  hanoi_recursive(1, 0, 2, 1, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (2, 2, 1)])
                    move_disk(1, 0, 1, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (2, 2, 1)])
              move_disk(4, 0, 2, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (2, 2, 1), (1, 0, 1)])
              hanoi_recursive(3, 1, 0, 2, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (2, 2, 1), (1, 0, 1), (4, 0, 2)])
                ...

So the first several moves are:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2.
... and so on.

Great, now I think I have a clear understanding of the recursion. Let me start listing the complete solution for n=10.

CORRECTION: I found an issue with my reasoning. Let me trace the recursion one more time to be sure.

For n=10, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2:

hanoi_recursive(10, 0, 1, 2, [])
  hanoi_recursive(9, 0, 2, 1, [])
    hanoi_recursive(8, 0, 1, 2, [])
      hanoi_recursive(7, 0, 2, 1, [])
        hanoi_recursive(6, 0, 1, 2, [])
          hanoi_recursive(5, 0, 2, 1, [])
            hanoi_recursive(4, 0, 1, 2, [])
              hanoi_recursive(3, 0, 2, 1, [])
                hanoi_recursive(2, 0, 1, 2, [])
                  hanoi_recursive(1, 0, 2, 1, [])
                    move_disk(1, 0, 1, [])
                  move_disk(2, 0, 2, [(1, 0, 1)])
                  hanoi_recursive(1, 1, 0, 2, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2)])
                    move_disk(1, 1, 2, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2)])
                move_disk(3, 0, 1, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2)])
                hanoi_recursive(2, 2, 0, 1, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1)])
                  hanoi_recursive(1, 2, 1, 0, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1)])
                    move_disk(1, 2, 0, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1)])
                  move_disk(2, 2, 1, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0)])
                  hanoi_recursive(1, 0, 2, 1, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (2, 2, 1)])
                    move_disk(1, 0, 1, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (2, 2, 1)])
              move_disk(4, 0, 2, [(1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (2, 2, 1), (1, 0, 1)])
              ...

So the first few moves are:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2.
...

I'm confirming that this matches the pattern I described earlier. Now, I'll list the complete solution for n=10, having 1023 moves in total.

Disk 1 is moved at steps: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, ..., 1023
Disk 2 is moved at steps: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, ...
Disk 3 is moved at steps: 4, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, 52, 60, ...
