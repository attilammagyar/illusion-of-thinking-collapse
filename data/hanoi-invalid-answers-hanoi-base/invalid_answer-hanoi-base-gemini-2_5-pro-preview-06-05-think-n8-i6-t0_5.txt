**Thinking Through the Tower of Hanoi for 8 Disks**

Okay, here's my thought process on solving the 8-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, focusing on providing a full list of moves as requested.  First, I'm breaking down the problem: eight disks, initial state all on peg 0, target on peg 2, standard rules (one disk at a time, bigger on smaller is forbidden). The output needs to be a list of `[disk_id, from_peg, to_peg]` moves.  The key here is that I need the *full* list of moves, not just a description of the algorithm.

Since this is a classic, recursion is the obvious approach. I'll define a function `Hanoi(n, source, destination, auxiliary)` to move `n` disks. The base case is moving one disk, a simple direct move. For `n > 1`, I break it down: first, move `n-1` disks to the auxiliary peg, then move the largest disk (`n`) to the destination, and finally move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination.  Each of these sub-moves can also be broken down recursively, and importantly, I have to generate the whole list, not just a verbal description of this process.

To confirm my understanding, I'm mentally sketching the recursive structure and how it handles different move scenarios. The initial call will be `Hanoi(8, 0, 2, 1)`. I'll also trace the first few steps, thinking:  "move 7 to 1, move 8 to 2, move 7 from 1 to 2..." and so on.

The next step is to actually *generate* the move list. While I could trace this manually (and I did for the smaller example with 3 disks, because I want to be 100% sure the logic is spot on), it's far too tedious for 8 disks (255 moves!). So I'll programmatically create a script to generate all moves automatically using the recursive approach.  The mental code I'm imagining is something very simple: recursively move n-1, move the nth, recursively move n-1. Then, that script would populate the list of moves. I've already confirmed my algorithm on the sample for 3 disks; it checks out.

So, I'll run the algorithm to generate the 255 moves.  The final output is that fully populated `moves` list.  This process guarantees that I follow the rules and provide a comprehensive move list. Then, present it in the requested format. Done.

Of course. This is the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle. The most efficient way to solve it is with a recursive algorithm. The total number of moves required for $n$ disks is $2^n - 1$. For 8 disks, this will be $2^8 - 1 = 255$ moves.

The strategy is as follows:
1.  Move the top 7 disks from the source peg (0) to the auxiliary peg (1).
2.  Move the largest disk (8) from the source peg (0) to the destination peg (2).
3.  Move the 7 disks from the auxiliary peg (1) to the destination peg (2).

Each of these steps is a smaller version of the same puzzle. Here is the complete sequence of 255 moves to solve the puzzle for 8 disks.
