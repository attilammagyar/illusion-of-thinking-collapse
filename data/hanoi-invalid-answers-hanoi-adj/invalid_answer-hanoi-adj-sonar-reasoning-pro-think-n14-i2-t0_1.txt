Okay, so I need to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for 14 disks. Let me recall how the Tower of Hanoi works. The classic solution involves recursion: move n-1 disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the target peg, and then move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg. But since the user wants the complete list of moves, I need to generate each individual move step by step.

First, the number of moves required for 14 disks is 2^14 - 1, which is 16383 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list. The challenge is to generate this list correctly without making any mistakes.

I remember that there's a pattern to the moves based on whether the number of disks is even or odd. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific cycle. Let me check the search results. According to the Gray code solution in [1], if the number of disks is even, the smallest disk cycles f → r → t → f → r → t, etc. Here, the source peg is 0, target is 2, so the remaining peg is 1. So for even disks (14 is even), the smallest disk (disk 1) should move 0 → 1 → 2 → 0 → 1 → 2, and so on.

Each move alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. The key is to determine which disk to move next. The Gray code method says that the disk to move is determined by the number of times the move number can be divided by 2. For move m (starting from 1), the disk is the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of m. For example, move 1 in binary is 1, which has 0 trailing zeros, so disk 1 (smallest) is moved. Move 2 is 10, which has 1 trailing zero, so disk 2. Move 3 is 11, 0 trailing zeros, disk 1 again. And so on.

So for each move from 1 to 16383, I need to calculate which disk to move. Then determine the direction based on the disk's parity and the total number of disks. Since there are 14 disks (even), the smallest disk moves in the order 0→1→2→0→1→2...

For other disks, the movement is determined by the rule that each disk moves in a specific pattern. For even-numbered disks (since total disks are even), the non-smallest disks move in the only valid direction possible. Wait, maybe I should use the recursive approach to generate the moves.

Alternatively, the recursive algorithm would generate the moves as follows:

To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:
1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using target.
2. Move disk n from source to target.
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target using source.

But implementing this recursively for 14 disks would require a lot of stack depth, but since I'm generating the list programmatically, perhaps I can simulate it.

But given that the user wants the exact list, maybe there's a pattern or iterative approach. Let me think about the iterative solution.

In the iterative approach, the moves are determined by the following rules:
- For even number of disks:
  - Make the legal move between pegs A and B (in a cycle).
  - Make the legal move between pegs A and C.
  - Make the legal move between pegs B and C.
  - Repeat until complete.
But I might be mixing up the exact steps here.

Alternatively, using the Gray code method, each move corresponds to a bit flip in the Gray code sequence. Each bit position corresponds to a disk, and the bit that changes indicates which disk to move. The direction is determined by the parity of the disk and the total number of disks.

Since the total disks are even (14), the smallest disk (disk 1) moves in the order 0→1→2→0→1→2... For each subsequent move of the smallest disk, it alternates between pegs in that cycle.

For other disks (disk 2 to 14), their moves are determined by the only valid move possible. For example, after moving the smallest disk, the next move must involve the next possible disk that can be moved, which is determined by the state of the pegs.

But generating this step by step for 14 disks would require tracking the state of each peg after each move, which is computationally intensive. However, since the problem is about generating the sequence, perhaps there's a formulaic way to determine each move's from and to pegs based on the move number.

Let me refer back to the Gray code solution in [1]. The disk to move is determined by the number of times the move number can be divided by 2 (i.e., the number of trailing zeros in binary plus one). For each move m (starting at 1), the disk is the position of the rightmost 0 bit in m's binary representation. Wait, maybe I need to adjust that.

Wait, the ordinal of the disk to be moved during move m is the number of times m can be divided by 2. So for m=1: 1 divided by 2 is 0 times, so disk 1. m=2: divided by 2 once, so disk 2. m=3: 3/2=1.5, so 1 time, but wait, maybe it's the exponent of 2 in m. For example, m=1: 2^0 doesn't divide 1, so 0 times. m=2: 2^1 divides 2 once. m=3: 2^0 divides 3 once. Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of m. For m=1 (binary 1), 0 trailing zeros → disk 1. m=2 (10), 1 trailing zero → disk 2. m=3 (11), 0 trailing zeros → disk 1. m=4 (100), 2 trailing zeros → disk 3. m=5 (101), 0 → disk 1. m=6 (110), 1 → disk 2. m=7 (111), 0 → disk 1. m=8 (1000), 3 trailing zeros → disk 4. So the disk to move is (number of trailing zeros in m) + 1. Wait, but in the example given in the query, for 3 disks, the moves start with disk 1, then 2, then 1, etc. So for move 1: disk 1, move 2: disk 2, move 3: disk 1, move 4: disk 3, etc. That matches the trailing zeros +1.

So for each move m (starting at 1), the disk to move is (number of trailing zeros in binary m) + 1. Then, the direction to move the disk depends on the disk's size parity and the total number of disks.

For the smallest disk (disk 1), the direction cycles based on whether the total number of disks is even or odd. Since we have 14 disks (even), the direction cycle is 0→1→2→0→1→2...

For other disks (disk d where d >1), the direction is determined by the following: if the disk is even-numbered (since total disks are even), then the direction alternates between the other two pegs in a specific pattern. Wait, perhaps for even-numbered disks, the movement is always between the two non-target pegs, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, according to [1], for the smallest disk, the direction is determined by the parity of the total disks. For even total disks, the cycle is f→r→t→f→r→t..., where f is the source peg (0), r is the auxiliary peg (1), and t is the target peg (2). So the smallest disk moves 0→1→2→0→1→2...

For other disks, the move is determined by the only valid move possible. After moving the smallest disk, the next move must involve the next disk that can be moved, which is the next smallest disk that's not under the smallest one. But tracking this for 14 disks would be complex.

Alternatively, using the Gray code method, once the disk to move is determined, the direction is determined by the following rule: for disks other than the smallest, there's only one valid move possible (since you can't place a larger disk on a smaller one). So after determining which disk to move, you check the current positions and move it to the only possible peg.

But generating this programmatically would require keeping track of the state of each disk's position. However, since the initial state is all disks on peg 0, and the target is all on peg 2, perhaps there's a pattern.

Alternatively, using the recursive approach, the sequence of moves can be generated by simulating the recursive steps. For 14 disks, the moves would be:

Move 14 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1.

Which breaks down into:

1. Move 13 disks from 0 to 1 using 2.
2. Move disk 14 from 0 to 2.
3. Move 13 disks from 1 to 2 using 0.

Each of these steps would further break down into smaller steps. But generating this recursively would produce the correct sequence. However, implementing this in code is necessary, but since I'm doing it manually, I need to find a pattern.

Alternatively, the iterative approach can be used. For each move, determine the disk to move based on the move number, then determine the direction based on the disk's size and the total number of disks.

Let me try to outline the steps for the first few moves to see the pattern.

For 14 disks (even):

Move 1: Disk 1 moves from 0→1 (since even total, cycle is 0→1→2→0...)
Move 2: Disk 2 moves. Where can it go? The only valid peg is 2, because disk 1 is on peg 1. So disk 2 moves from 0→2.
Move 3: Disk 1 moves from 1→2.
Move 4: Disk 3 moves. Where? The pegs are: disk 3 is on 0, disk 2 on 2, disk 1 on 2. So disk 3 can't go to 2 (smaller disks there), so it must go to 1. So disk 3 moves 0→1.
Move 5: Disk 1 moves from 2→0.
Move 6: Disk 2 moves from 2→1 (since disk 1 is on 0, and disk 3 is on 1, so disk 2 can go on top of disk 3).
Move 7: Disk 1 moves from 0→1.
Move 8: Disk 4 moves. It's on peg 0. Can't go to peg 1 (disk 3 and 2 there), so moves to peg 2.
Move 9: Disk 1 moves from 1→2.
Move 10: Disk 2 moves from 1→0.
Move 11: Disk 1 moves from 2→0.
Move 12: Disk 3 moves from 1→2 (since disk 4 is on 2, but disk 3 is smaller, so it can go there).
Move 13: Disk 1 moves from 0→1.
Move 14: Disk 2 moves from 0→2.
Move 15: Disk 1 moves from 1→2.
Move 16: Disk 5 moves from 0→1.
... and so on.

This pattern continues, with each even move involving a larger disk, and the smallest disk cycling through pegs 0→1→2→0...

But generating all 16383 moves manually is impossible. Therefore, I need to find an algorithm that can generate each move step by step.

The key is to determine for each move m (from 1 to 16383):

1. Determine which disk to move: disk = number of trailing zeros in binary(m) + 1.
2. Determine the direction to move that disk.

For the direction:

- If the disk is 1 (smallest), follow the cycle based on even total disks: 0→1→2→0...
- For other disks, determine the possible pegs they can move to. Since the disk can only move to a peg where the top disk is larger, or the peg is empty.

But how to determine the direction without tracking the entire state?

An alternative approach from [1] mentions that for the smallest disk, the direction is determined by the total number of disks. For even, it's f→r→t→f... For odd, f→t→r→f...

For other disks, there's only one valid move each time they are moved. So once the disk is determined, the from peg is where it currently is, and the to peg is the only possible one.

But to determine the to peg without tracking the state, perhaps there's a pattern based on the disk's number.

Another approach from [4] mentions Poole's algorithm, which works for arbitrary configurations and provides the minimal moves. But I don't have details on Poole's algorithm here.

Alternatively, the recursive approach can be simulated. Let's consider that moving n disks from source to target using auxiliary involves:

1. Moving n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.
2. Moving the nth disk from source to target.
3. Moving n-1 disks from auxiliary to target.

Each of these steps can be represented as a sequence of moves. For n=14, this would generate a very long list, but it's the correct sequence.

However, implementing this recursively would require a function that builds the move list. Since I can't write code here, I need to find a way to represent this.

Alternatively, the minimal number of moves is known (2^14 -1 = 16383), and each move can be determined by the recursive pattern.

But how to list all 16383 moves? It's impractical manually, but perhaps the user expects the answer to be generated programmatically, even though I'm supposed to write it out here.

Wait, the user says they will parse the answer automatically, so the list must be complete and in the correct order. However, generating such a long list within the token limit is impossible. But the user insists, so I must provide it.

But given the constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to output the list in the required format, even if it's truncated due to token limits. However, the user explicitly says not to truncate and to output the complete list, even if it risks running out of tokens. So I must try.

But how? The only way is to generate the list programmatically, but I can't write code here. Alternatively, I can use the recursive approach's pattern to describe the moves.

Wait, the example given for 3 disks has the moves:

[[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2]]

Which corresponds to the standard solution:

Move 1 from 0 to 2

Move 2 from 0 to 1

Move 1 from 2 to 1

Move 3 from 0 to 2

Move 1 from 1 to 0

Move 2 from 1 to 2

Move 1 from 0 to 2

For 3 disks, 7 moves.

Similarly, for 14 disks, the sequence would follow the same recursive pattern but with many more steps.

But listing all 16383 moves here is impossible manually. However, perhaps the assistant has a way to generate this list algorithmically within the answer.

Alternatively, the assistant can output the list in a compressed form, but the user insists on the exact format without truncation. Given that, perhaps the assistant is expected to provide the correct algorithm and then the list, but given the token limits, it's impossible.

Wait, but the user says, "This is a benchmark test where the first invalid or incomplete move you generate matters. The more valid and parsable moves you generate from the optimal solution, the better your score will be. Truncating the list in any way risks a very low score. Therefore your best strategy is to attempt to output the complete list, even if you risk running out of output tokens."

So the assistant must output as many correct moves as possible, even if it's cut off. But the correct answer requires all 16383 moves. However, given the context, perhaps the assistant can generate the list using the recursive approach, but since it's too long, the answer will be truncated. But the user insists, so the assistant must try.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical way to generate each move's from and to pegs based on the move number and the disk involved.

Using the Gray code method:

For each move m (1-based), the disk to move is d = number of trailing zeros in m's binary representation + 1.

Then, for disk d:

- If d is 1 (smallest), the direction follows the cycle based on even total disks (14 is even): 0→1→2→0→1→2...

- For other disks, the move is determined by the only valid move possible. Since the disk can only move to one of the other two pegs, and the peg must have a larger disk or be empty.

But without tracking the state, how to determine the direction for larger disks?

An alternative approach from [1] states that for non-smallest disks, the move is determined by the parity of the disk's position. However, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the Gray code solution in [1] says that for non-smallest disks, the move is determined by the only valid move available. So once the disk to move is determined, the from peg is where it currently is, and the to peg is the only possible one that's valid.

But to determine this without tracking the state, perhaps there's a pattern based on the number of times the disk has been moved before.

Alternatively, the direction for non-smallest disks alternates between two pegs. For example, disk 2 alternates between pegs 0 and 2, then 0 and 1, depending on the total disks.

But I'm not sure. Let's think about the example for 3 disks:

Moves for disk 2 are from 0→1, then 1→2.

Disk 3 moves from 0→2.

Disk 2 again moves from 1→2.

So for disk 2, the moves are 0→1 and then 1→2.

But this depends on the recursive steps.

Alternatively, for even-numbered total disks, the non-smallest disks move in a certain pattern, and for odd-numbered, another.

But I'm stuck. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to use the recursive method to generate the moves.

The recursive function to generate moves is:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}")
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}")
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

For n=3, this produces the correct sequence.

Applying this to n=14, the sequence would be:

Move 13 disks from 0 to 1 using 2.

Move disk 14 from 0 to 2.

Move 13 disks from 1 to 2 using 0.

Each of those 13-disk moves would further break down.

But generating this entire sequence manually is impossible. However, the assistant must output the list.

Given that, perhaps the assistant can generate the list programmatically and output it here. But since I can't run code, I have to rely on the search results and known algorithms.

Alternatively, the assistant can use the iterative approach based on the Gray code solution, which allows determining each move step by step.

Let's try to outline the steps for the iterative approach:

Initialize pegs: all disks on peg 0.

For each move m from 1 to 16383:

1. Determine the disk to move: d = number of trailing zeros in binary(m) + 1.

2. For disk d:

   a. If d is 1 (smallest):

      i. For even total disks (14), move in the cycle 0→1→2→0...

      ii. The direction is determined by (m-1) mod 3. Wait, for each move of the smallest disk, the direction cycles. Since the smallest disk moves every other move, the direction depends on how many times it has been moved before.

      For example, the first move (m=1): direction 0→1.

      Second move of disk 1 (m=3): 1→2.

      Third move (m=5): 2→0.

      Fourth move (m=7): 0→1, etc.

      So the cycle is 0→1→2→0→1→2...

      The number of times the smallest disk has been moved before is (m +1)/2. For m=1: (1+1)/2=1 → first move: 0→1.

      So the to_peg for disk 1 is (from_peg +1) mod 3 if the total moves of disk 1 is odd, or (from_peg +2) mod 3 if even? Wait, perhaps it's simpler to track the direction based on the move count of the smallest disk.

      Since the total disks are even, the smallest disk moves in the order 0→1→2→0...

      So for each move of the smallest disk, the to_peg is the next peg in the cycle.

      The from_peg is the current peg of the smallest disk.

      So for the first move, disk 1 is at 0 → move to 1.

      Second move of disk 1 is at 1 → move to 2.

      Third move: 2 → 0.

      Fourth move: 0 →1, etc.

   b. For other disks (d >1):

      i. The disk can only move to one of the other two pegs.

      ii. The valid move is to the peg that is not the same as the last move of the smallest disk.

      iii. Alternatively, the disk must move to the peg that is not the current peg of the smallest disk.

      Wait, perhaps for non-smallest disks, the move is determined by the parity of the disk's size.

      For even-numbered disks (like d=2,4,6...), the move alternates between the two pegs that are not the current peg of the smallest disk.

      But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for non-smallest disks, the valid move is determined by the following rule: the disk must move to the peg that is neither the current peg of the smallest disk nor the peg it was previously on.

But without tracking the state, this is challenging.

Given the complexity, perhaps the correct approach is to use the recursive method's move sequence, which is well-defined, and output the list accordingly.

However, generating all 16383 moves here is impractical. But the user insists, so I must proceed.

Given that, the assistant will output the list of moves in the required format, generated using the recursive algorithm. Each move is determined by the recursive decomposition.

The list starts with moving disk 1 from 0 to 1, then disk 2 from 0 to 2, then disk 1 from 1 to 2, and so on, following the recursive pattern.

But since the list is extremely long, the assistant will start generating the moves and continue until the token limit is reached, ensuring that the list is as complete as possible.

The final answer will be the list of moves in the specified format, starting with moves=[[1,0,1],[2,0,2],[1,1,2],...] and continuing up to the 16383rd move.
