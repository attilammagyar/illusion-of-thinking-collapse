# Tower of Hanoi Solution for 5 Disks

I'll solve this Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 5 disks. This is a classic recursive problem with a well-defined solution.

## Thinking Process

For the Tower of Hanoi with n disks, the minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1. With 5 disks, we'll need 2^5 - 1 = 31 moves.

The recursive strategy is:
1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary peg
2. Move the largest disk from source to destination peg
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination peg

Let me work through the complete solution for 5 disks:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. Move disks 1-4 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
   - This requires moving disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1: [1, 0, 1]
   - Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2: [2, 0, 2]
   - Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2: [1, 1, 2]
   - Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1: [3, 0, 1]
   - Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0: [1, 2, 0]
   - Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1: [2, 2, 1]
   - Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1: [1, 0, 1]
   - Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2: [4, 0, 2]
   - Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2: [1, 1, 2]
   - Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0: [2, 1, 0]
   - Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0: [1, 2, 0]
   - Move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2: [3, 1, 2]
   - Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1: [1, 0, 1]
   - Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2: [2, 0, 2]
   - Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2: [1, 1, 2]

2. Move disk 5 from peg 0 to peg 2: [5, 0, 2]

3. Move disks 1-4 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)
   - Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0: [1, 2, 0]
   - Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1: [2, 2, 1]
   - Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1: [1, 0, 1]
   - Move disk 3 from peg 2 to peg 0: [3, 2, 0]
   - Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2: [1, 1, 2]
   - Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0: [2, 1, 0]
   - Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0: [1, 2, 0]
   - Move disk 4 from peg 1 to peg 2: [4, 1, 2]
   - Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1: [1, 0, 1]
   - Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2: [2, 0, 2]
   - Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2: [1, 1, 2]
   - Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2: [3, 0, 2]
   - Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0: [1, 2, 0]
   - Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1: [2, 2, 1]
   - Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1: [1, 0, 1]

## Final Solution

```
moves = [[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], 
         [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], 
         [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], 
         [5, 0, 2], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], 
         [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [4, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], 
         [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 2], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], 
         [1, 0, 1]]
```

This sequence of 31 moves will successfully transfer all 5 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 following all the required rules.
