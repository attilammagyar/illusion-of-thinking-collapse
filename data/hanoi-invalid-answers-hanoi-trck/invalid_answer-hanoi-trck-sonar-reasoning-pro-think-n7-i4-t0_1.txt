Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any explanation, just the raw data in the specified format. First, I remember that the minimum number of moves required for n disks is 2^n - 1. For 7 disks, that's 127 moves. So the solution should have exactly 127 moves.

The iterative solution mentioned in the sources alternates moving the smallest disk and another disk. Since 7 is odd, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move in a specific pattern. From the Wikipedia source, the iterative solution for an odd number of disks involves moving the smallest disk to the next peg in a cyclic manner (right if even, left if odd). Wait, the source says for even disks, the smallest moves to the right, and for odd, to the left. But the example with 3 disks (odd) starts by moving disk 1 to the opposite end. Hmm, need to clarify.

Looking at the example provided in the query for 3 disks, the moves start with moving disk 1 from peg 0 to 2. Then disk 2 from 0 to 1, and so on. That seems to follow the pattern where each move of the smallest disk alternates direction. For 7 disks, which is odd, the initial direction for the smallest disk should be to the right, but maybe the pattern is different. Wait, the source [3] mentions that for an odd number of disks, the smallest piece moves to the left, but the example in the query for 3 disks starts by moving to the right (peg 2). Maybe there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, the user's example for 3 disks shows the first move as moving disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Then disk 2 from 0 to 1, etc. So perhaps the direction depends on the number of disks. The source [2] mentions that for even disks, the movement is reversed. So for 7 disks (odd), the smallest disk moves in a left direction initially. But in the example, with 3 disks (odd), the first move is to the right. Maybe the direction is determined by the parity of the number of disks. Let me check the sources again.

Source [3] says: "When moving the smallest piece, always move it to the next position in the same direction (to the right if the starting number of pieces is even, to the left if the starting number of pieces is odd)." Wait, that's the opposite. So if the number of disks is even, move right; if odd, move left. But in the user's example with 3 disks (odd), the first move is to peg 2 (right). That contradicts. Wait, maybe the user's example is incorrect, or perhaps the source is different. Alternatively, maybe the direction is determined by the step in the algorithm.

Wait, the user's example for 3 disks starts with moving disk 1 to peg 2. Then disk 2 to peg 1, then disk 1 to peg 1, etc. Let me see the iterative solution steps. Source [3] says for the iterative solution, alternate moves between the smallest and non-smallest. For the smallest, move it in a direction (right if even, left if odd). So for 7 disks (odd), the smallest should move left each time. But left from peg 0 would be peg 2 (since it's cyclic). Wait, maybe the direction is cyclic. For example, moving left from peg 0 would be to peg 2, then next left to peg 1, etc. Or maybe it's a circular direction where left is peg 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0, etc.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to outline the steps for 7 disks. The iterative approach would involve moving the smallest disk in a specific direction each time, alternating with moving the only possible non-smallest disk. For 7 disks, which is odd, the smallest disk moves in a left direction. But since the pegs are 0, 1, 2, moving left from 0 would be to peg 2 (as it's a circular arrangement). Then next move left would be peg 2 to peg 1, then peg 1 to peg 0, etc.

Alternatively, the direction could be determined by the parity of the move number. But I need to follow the algorithm correctly. Let's refer back to the sources. Source [3] states: "When moving the smallest piece, always move it to the next position in the same direction (to the right if the starting number of pieces is even, to the left if the starting number of pieces is odd). If there is no tower position in the chosen direction, move the piece to the opposite end, but then continue to move in the correct direction."

So for 7 disks (odd), the direction is left. Starting at peg 0, moving left would mean peg 0 -> peg 2 (since left from 0 is 2 in a circular manner). Then next move left would be peg 2 -> peg 1, then peg 1 -> peg 0, and so on. Each time the smallest disk moves left, unless that's not possible (e.g., if the next left peg has a smaller disk on top). Wait, but the movement of the smallest disk is only allowed if it doesn't violate the rule of placing a larger disk on a smaller one. However, since the smallest disk can always be placed on any other disk, the direction is followed regardless.

So the algorithm would be:

1. Move the smallest disk (1) to the next peg in the direction (left for odd n).
2. Make the only possible move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.
3. Repeat until all disks are on the target peg.

For 7 disks, the target is peg 2. Let's start generating the moves.

Move 1: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2 (left direction). Now peg0: 7,6,5,4,3,2; peg2: 1.

Move 2: The only possible non-smallest move is moving disk 2 from peg0 to peg1. So move disk 2 from 0 to 1.

Move 3: Move disk 1 from peg2 to peg1 (left direction from peg2 would be peg1). But wait, peg1 has disk 2, which is larger, so placing disk 1 on peg1 is allowed.

Move 4: Move disk 3 from peg0 to peg2.

Move 5: Move disk 1 from peg1 to peg0.

Move 6: Move disk 2 from peg1 to peg2.

Move 7: Move disk 1 from peg0 to peg2.

Move 8: Move disk4 from peg0 to peg1.

And this pattern continues. Each time, after moving the smallest disk, the next move is the only possible non-smallest disk move. This process would continue until all disks are moved to peg2.

But generating all 127 moves manually is error-prone. However, the user provided sources mention that the solution for 7 disks is available in source [1] and [4]. Let me check those. Source [1] is a video titled "Tower of Hanoi: Seven Rings(Disks) Solution 7." Source [4] is another video titled "Tower of Hanoi 7 Disks Tutorial | The easy way." These likely show the step-by-step moves. However, since I can't watch the videos, I need to rely on the text descriptions.

Source [2] provides a step-by-step for a seven-disk puzzle. It mentions steps like moving disk 1 to the left, then disk 2, etc., following an algorithm. The key is that for each "big disk" (like disk 3, 4, etc.), you have to move the smaller disks out of the way using the same pattern.

The example in the query for 3 disks has 7 moves. Following that pattern, for 7 disks, each larger disk requires moving all smaller disks twice. The total moves are 2^7 -1 = 127.

To generate the move list, I need to follow the recursive approach: To move n disks from peg A to peg C, you move n-1 disks from A to B, then move the nth disk from A to C, then move n-1 disks from B to C. But since the user wants the iterative solution, which is more efficient in terms of steps, I need to follow the iterative algorithm.

Alternatively, the iterative approach can be implemented by noting the pattern of moves. For 7 disks, the sequence of moves for the smallest disk alternates between pegs in a left direction. Each time the smallest disk moves, the next move is the only possible non-smallest move.

But without the exact move list, I need to construct it step by step. Let's try to outline the first few moves and see the pattern.

Move 1: 1 from 0 to 2
Move 2: 2 from 0 to 1
Move 3: 1 from 2 to 1
Move 4: 3 from 0 to 2
Move 5: 1 from 1 to 0
Move 6: 2 from 1 to 2
Move 7: 1 from 0 to 2
Move 8: 4 from 0 to 1
Move 9: 1 from 2 to 1
Move 10: 2 from 2 to 0
Move 11: 1 from 1 to 0
Move 12: 3 from 2 to 1
Move 13: 1 from 0 to 2
Move 14: 2 from 0 to 1
Move 15: 1 from 2 to 1
Move 16: 5 from 0 to 2
...

This pattern continues, with each even-numbered move (excluding the first) involving moving the next larger disk. The challenge is to ensure that each move is valid and doesn't place a larger disk on a smaller one.

However, manually listing all 127 moves is impractical. Instead, I can use the fact that the iterative solution follows a specific pattern based on binary counting or gray codes. Each move corresponds to a bit flip in a binary counter, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the iterative algorithm can be described as follows:

For each move from 1 to 2^n -1:
- If the move number is odd, move the smallest disk in the predetermined direction (left for odd n).
- If the move number is even, make the only possible move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

Given that 7 is odd, the direction for the smallest disk is left (peg 0 -> 2, 2 -> 1, 1 -> 0, etc.).

But to generate the exact sequence, I need to implement this algorithm. Since I can't compute all 127 moves here, I'll have to rely on the sources. Source [2] mentions that for a seven-disk puzzle, you follow the "odd algorithm" repeatedly. Each time you move the smallest disk left, then the next disk, etc.

The example in the query for 3 disks has the following moves:

1,0,2,3 2,,1
2,0,1,3,2,1
3,2,1,3,2 1,
4,0,2,,2 1,3
5,1,0,1,2,3
6,1,2,1,,3 2
7,0,2,,,3 2 1

This shows that after each move of a larger disk, the smaller disks are moved around. For 7 disks, the pattern would be similar but much longer.

Given the complexity, the correct approach is to generate the move list using the iterative algorithm, ensuring that each move follows the rules. The final answer must list all 127 moves in the specified format, with each move's from_peg, to_peg, and the state of each peg after the move.

However, without the exact move list from the sources, I'll have to construct it algorithmically. Let's outline the steps for the first few moves and then extrapolate.

Move 1: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Peg0: 7,6,5,4,3,2; Peg2: 1.
Move 2: Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1. Peg0: 7,6,5,4,3; Peg1: 2; Peg2: 1.
Move 3: Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1. Peg1: 2,1; Peg2: empty.
Move 4: Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2. Peg0: 7,6,5,4; Peg2: 3.
Move 5: Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0. Peg0: 7,6,5,4,1; Peg1: 2.
Move 6: Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2. Peg1: empty; Peg2: 3,2.
Move 7: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Peg0: 7,6,5,4; Peg2: 3,2,1.
Move 8: Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 1. Peg0: 7,6,5; Peg1: 4.
Move 9: Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1. Peg1: 4,1; Peg2: 3,2.
Move 10: Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 0. Peg0: 7,6,5,2; Peg2: 3.
Move 11: Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0. Peg0: 7,6,5,2,1; Peg1: 4.
Move 12: Move disk 3 from peg 2 to peg 1. Peg1: 4,3; Peg2: empty.
Move 13: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Peg0: 7,6,5,2; Peg2: 1.
Move 14: Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1. Peg0: 7,6,5; Peg1: 4,3,2.
Move 15: Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1. Peg1: 4,3,2,1; Peg2: empty.
Move 16: Move disk 5 from peg 0 to peg 2. Peg0: 7,6; Peg2: 5.
...

Continuing this pattern, each time moving the smallest disk left (0->2, 2->1, 1->0, etc.), and then moving the next available disk. This process would continue until all disks are on peg 2.

Given the complexity, the final answer must list all 127 moves correctly. Since the user insists on the complete list without truncation, I'll proceed to generate the full list following the iterative algorithm, ensuring each move adheres to the rules and the peg states are correctly updated after each move.
