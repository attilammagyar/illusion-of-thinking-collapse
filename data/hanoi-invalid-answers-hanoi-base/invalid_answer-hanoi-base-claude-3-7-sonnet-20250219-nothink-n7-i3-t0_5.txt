# Tower of Hanoi with 7 Disks

This is the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 7 disks. I'll solve it systematically.

## Solution Strategy

The Tower of Hanoi has a recursive solution pattern:
1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary peg
2. Move the largest disk from source to destination
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination

For 7 disks, we need 2^7-1 = 127 moves in the optimal solution.

## Solution Steps

Let me work through the complete solution:

```
# Initial state: [[7,6,5,4,3,2,1],[],[]]

# Step 1: Move 6 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2 as auxiliary
# Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
[[7,6,5,4,3,2],[],[1]]
# Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1
[[7,6,5,4,3],[2],[1]]
# Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
[[7,6,5,4,3],[2,1],[]]
# Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2
[[7,6,5,4],[2,1],[3]]
# Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
[[7,6,5,4,1],[2],[3]]
# Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2
[[7,6,5,4,1],[],[3,2]]
# Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
[[7,6,5,4],[],[3,2,1]]
# Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 1
[[7,6,5],[4],[3,2,1]]
# Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
[[7,6,5],[4,1],[3,2]]
# Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 0
[[7,6,5,2],[4,1],[3]]
# Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
[[7,6,5,2,1],[4],[3]]
# Move disk 3 from peg 2 to peg 1
[[7,6,5,2,1],[4,3],[]]

# Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2
[[7,6,1],[4,3],[5,2]]
# Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
[[7,6],[4,3],[5,2,1]]
# Move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 0
[[7,6,3],[4],[5,2,1]]
# Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
[[7,6,3],[4,1],[5,2]]
# Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 0
[[7,6,3,2],[4,1],[5]]
# Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
[[7,6,3,2,1],[4],[5]]
# Move disk 4 from peg 1 to peg 2
[[7,6,3,2,1],[],[5,4]]
# Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
[[7,6,3,2],[],[5,4,1]]
# Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1
[[7,6,3],[2],[5,4,1]]
# Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
[[7,6,3],[2,1],[5,4]]
# Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2
[[7,6],[2,1],[5,4,3]]
# Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
[[7,6,1],[2],[5,4,3]]
# Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2
[[7,6,1],[],[5,4,3,2]]
# Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
[[7,6],[],[5,4,3,2,1]]
# Move disk 6 from peg 0 to peg 1
[[7],[6],[5,4,3,2,1]]
```

I'll continue with the remaining moves:

```
