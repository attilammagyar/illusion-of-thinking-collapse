Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 10 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to move all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's a classic problem, I remember the recursive approach: move n-1 disks to the auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the target, and then move the n-1 disks onto the target. 

For 10 disks, the minimum number of moves is 2^10 - 1 = 1023. So the list should have exactly 1023 moves. Let me recall the recursive algorithm's steps. Each move can be determined by the recursive breakdown. 

Starting with the base case: 1 disk is straightforward. For 2 disks, it's move 1 to aux, move 2 to target, move 1 to target. For each additional disk, the pattern repeats but with changing the roles of the pegs. 

But generating the exact sequence for 10 disks manually would be error-prone. However, the recursive approach can be translated into an iterative method using a stack or by following the pattern of moves. Alternatively, there's a pattern based on the parity of the disk number. Even-numbered disks move in one direction, odd in another. But I need to ensure the exact order.

Wait, the standard solution for Tower of Hanoi follows a specific pattern where each odd-numbered move involves the smallest disk. The smallest disk moves cyclically: for an even number of disks, it moves right (0→1→2→0), and for odd, left (0→2→1→0). But since there are 10 disks (even), the smallest disk (1) should move right each time. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, the recursive approach would generate the moves as follows:
- To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:
1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using target as the auxiliary.
2. Move disk n from source to target.
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target using source as the auxiliary.

Each of these steps is recursive. So for 10 disks, the first step is moving 9 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary). Then move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2. Then move 9 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).

But how to translate this into the exact sequence of moves? Each recursive call would generate the moves in the order of the steps. So the sequence would be all the moves from step 1, then the single move of disk 10, then all the moves from step 3.

But since the problem requires the list of moves in the format [[disk, from, to], ...], I need to generate each individual move. Since doing this manually is impossible, perhaps there's a pattern or a way to generate the moves programmatically.

Alternatively, I can use the iterative approach which involves alternating between moving the smallest disk and making the only other valid move. For even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a cycle: 0→1→2→0, etc. Each time after moving the smallest, the next move is the only possible valid move not involving the smallest disk. This alternation continues until all disks are moved.

But how to determine the exact sequence? Let's think about the iterative algorithm steps:

1. While there are moves to make:
   a. Move the smallest disk to the next peg in the cycle (right for even, left for odd total disks).
   b. Make the only other valid move possible (which doesn't involve the smallest disk).

Since there are 10 disks (even), the smallest disk moves right: 0→1→2→0...

Each move of the smallest disk is followed by the only possible move between the other two pegs that doesn't involve the smallest disk. This alternation continues until all disks are moved.

But to generate the exact list, I need to simulate this process. Let's try to outline the first few moves for 3 disks to see the pattern, then extrapolate.

For 3 disks (odd), the smallest moves left (0→2→1→0...). But in the example given in the search results, the solution for 3 disks is:

moves=[[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2]]

Wait, that's 7 moves. Let's check:

1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2

Yes, that's correct. Now, applying the iterative approach for 3 disks (odd), the smallest disk (1) moves left (0→2→1→0...). Let's see:

Move 1: disk 1 from 0→2 (smallest move left)
Then the only other move is disk 2 from 0→1 (since disk 1 is on 2, can't move there)
Move 2: disk 2 from 0→1
Then move disk 1 from 2→1 (smallest move left again)
Move 3: disk 1 from 2→1
Then move disk 3 from 0→2 (only possible move)
Move 4: disk 3 from 0→2
Then move disk 1 from 1→0 (smallest move left)
Move 5: disk 1 from 1→0
Then move disk 2 from 1→2 (only possible move)
Move 6: disk 2 from 1→2
Then move disk 1 from 0→2 (smallest move left)
Move 7: disk 1 from 0→2

Which matches the example. So the iterative approach works. For even n, the smallest disk moves right (0→1→2→0...), and for odd n, left. But in our case, n=10 (even), so the smallest disk moves right each time.

So the algorithm for even n is:

1. Make the legal move between pegs that doesn't involve the smallest disk, or if possible, move the smallest disk to the next peg in the right direction (0→1→2→0...).

Wait, no. The iterative algorithm alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only other possible move. So for each iteration:

- Move the smallest disk in the direction (right for even n).
- Then make the only other possible move (which doesn't involve the smallest disk).

This alternation continues until all disks are moved.

So for n=10, the sequence would start with moving disk 1 from 0→1, then the next move is between the other two pegs (0 and 2), choosing the only valid move. Then move disk 1 again, etc.

But generating all 1023 moves manually is impossible. However, the recursive approach can be used to generate the sequence programmatically. Since the user insists on the complete list, I need to find a way to output it.

But how? The recursive approach's move sequence can be generated by following the steps:

For moving n disks from source to target using auxiliary:

If n == 1:
   move disk 1 from source to target
Else:
   move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using target
   move disk n from source to target
   move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target using source

So each move can be represented as per these recursive steps. For n=10, the first step is moving 9 disks from 0 to 1 (using 2 as auxiliary), then moving disk 10 from 0 to 2, then moving 9 disks from 1 to 2 (using 0 as auxiliary).

Each of these steps would recursively break down into smaller moves. The total number of moves is 2^10 -1 = 1023.

But to generate the exact list, I need to simulate this recursion. However, since I can't write code here, I have to rely on the pattern.

Alternatively, the sequence of moves can be determined by the binary representation of the move numbers. Each move corresponds to a bit in the binary count, and the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the move number's binary representation plus one. The direction depends on the disk's parity.

But this might be complex. Let me think: for each move number m (from 1 to 2^n -1), the disk to move is the number of trailing zeros in m's binary representation plus 1. The direction is determined by whether the disk is even or odd. For even-numbered disks, the direction is clockwise (0→1→2→0), for odd, counter-clockwise (0→2→1→0). Wait, but n=10 is even, so maybe the direction is adjusted based on the total number of disks.

Wait, according to some sources, the direction of the smallest disk's move depends on whether the total number of disks is even or odd. For even, it moves right (0→1→2→0), for odd, left (0→2→1→0). The other moves are determined by the only possible move between the other two pegs.

But how to determine which disk is being moved each time? The smallest disk moves every other move. The moves alternate between moving the smallest disk and another disk. So for 10 disks, the sequence would be:

Move 1: disk 1 from 0→1

Move 2: disk 2 from 0→2 (since after moving disk 1, the only other move is disk 2 from 0 to 2, as disk 1 is on 1 and can't go under disk 2)

Move 3: disk 1 from 1→2

Move 4: disk 3 from 0→1

Move 5: disk 1 from 2→0

Move 6: disk 2 from 2→1

Move 7: disk 1 from 0→1

Move 8: disk 4 from 0→2

... and so on.

But this pattern continues, with each even-numbered move involving a larger disk. However, manually listing all 1023 moves is impractical. The user expects the complete list, so I need to generate it algorithmically.

Given that the recursive approach is the standard way, and the example for 3 disks follows the recursive steps, the correct move sequence for 10 disks would be generated by the recursive algorithm. Therefore, the solution is to apply the recursive steps and output each move as per the algorithm.

But since I can't compute it here, I have to rely on the fact that the recursive method will produce the correct sequence. The key is to ensure that each move follows the rules and builds up correctly.

Therefore, the final answer is the recursive Tower of Hanoi solution for 10 disks, moving from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as auxiliary. Each move is generated by the recursive steps, resulting in 1023 moves. The exact sequence can be generated by a recursive function, but since I can't execute code, I must output the list as per the recursive algorithm's structure.
