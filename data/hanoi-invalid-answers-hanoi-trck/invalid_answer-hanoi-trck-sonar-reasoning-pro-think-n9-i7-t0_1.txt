Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 9 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's 9 disks, the minimum number of moves should be 2^9 - 1, which is 511 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list without truncation.

First, I need to recall the standard solution for Tower of Hanoi. The recursive approach is to move the top n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the target peg, and then move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary to the target. But since the user wants an explicit list, I have to generate each move step by step.

Looking at the search results, the iterative solution mentioned in [5] might be useful. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Wait, 9 is odd. According to the iterative solution, when the number of disks is odd, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move in a cycle: peg 0 → peg 2 → peg 1 → peg 0, and so on. The non-smallest moves are determined by the only legal move available.

But generating all 511 moves manually is impossible. However, the example given in the problem for 3 disks shows a specific pattern. Let me see that example again. The moves alternate between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For 3 disks, the sequence starts with moving disk 1, then disk 2, then disk 1 again, etc.

So for 9 disks, the pattern would involve alternating between moving the smallest disk and the next available disk. Each time, the smallest disk moves in a specific direction (left or right) based on the parity of the number of disks. Since 9 is odd, the smallest disk moves to the right (peg 0 → peg 2 → peg 1 → peg 0...).

But how to translate this into the exact sequence of moves? The iterative algorithm steps mentioned in [5] say to alternate between moving the smallest and the non-smallest. Each time the smallest moves in a set direction, and the non-smallest has only one legal move.

To generate the list, I can simulate the moves step by step. Let's start:

1. Move 1 from peg 0 to peg 2 (smallest disk first move).
2. Move the next possible disk, which is disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 1.
... and so on.

This pattern continues, with each even-numbered move involving the smallest disk and the odd-numbered moves involving the next available disk. However, manually listing all 511 moves is impractical. But the user provided search results [1] and [2] which are videos showing the solution for 9 disks. The transcript in [1] mentions moving all 9 disks in 511 moves, but the exact sequence isn't provided. The example in the problem for 3 disks has 7 moves, which matches 2^3 -1.

Since the user requires the complete list, I need to generate it programmatically. However, as an AI, I can't execute code, but I can outline the algorithm and then attempt to generate the moves step by step, following the iterative approach.

The iterative algorithm steps from [5] are:

1. For an odd number of disks:
   - Move the smallest disk in a cyclic manner (0→2→1→0...).
   - For non-smallest moves, there's only one legal move.

So, the steps would be:

- Initialize pegs: peg0 = [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], peg1 = [], peg2 = [].
- The smallest disk is 1. The first move is to move it from peg0 to peg2.
- Next, move the next possible disk (which is 2) from peg0 to peg1.
- Then move disk1 from peg2 to peg1.
- Then move disk3 from peg0 to peg2.
- Continue this pattern, alternating between moving disk1 and the next available disk.

Each time after moving disk1, the next move is the only possible legal move that doesn't involve disk1. This requires keeping track of the state of each peg after each move.

Given the complexity, the correct approach is to simulate each move step by step, ensuring that each move follows the rules. However, generating all 511 moves here would exceed the response length, but the user insists on the complete list. Therefore, I must proceed to generate the moves as per the iterative algorithm, ensuring correct peg states after each move.

Let me start generating the moves:

1. Move 1 from peg0 to peg2. Peg0: 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2; peg2: 1.
2. Move 2 from peg0 to peg1. Peg0: 9,8,7,6,5,4,3; peg1: 2.
3. Move 1 from peg2 to peg1. Peg1: 2,1; peg2: empty.
4. Move 3 from peg0 to peg2. Peg0: 9,8,7,6,5,4; peg2: 3.
5. Move 1 from peg1 to peg0. Peg0: 9,8,7,6,5,4,1; peg1: 2.
6. Move 2 from peg1 to peg2. Peg2: 3,2; peg1: empty.
7. Move 1 from peg0 to peg2. Peg2: 3,2,1; peg0: 9,8,7,6,5,4.
8. Move 4 from peg0 to peg1. Peg0: 9,8,7,6,5; peg1:4.
9. Move 1 from peg2 to peg1. Peg1:4,1; peg2:3,2.
10. Move 2 from peg2 to peg0. Peg0:9,8,7,6,5,2; peg2:3.
11. Move 1 from peg1 to peg0. Peg0:9,8,7,6,5,2,1; peg1:4.
12. Move 3 from peg2 to peg1. Peg1:4,3; peg2: empty.
13. Move 1 from peg0 to peg2. Peg2:1; peg0:9,8,7,6,5,2.
14. Move 2 from peg0 to peg1. Peg1:4,3,2; peg0:9,8,7,6,5.
15. Move 1 from peg2 to peg1. Peg1:4,3,2,1; peg2: empty.
16. Move 5 from peg0 to peg2. Peg0:9,8,7,6; peg2:5.
... and this continues until all disks are moved.

Each step alternates moving the smallest disk (1) and the next available disk. The pattern repeats, with each larger disk requiring moving all smaller disks out of the way. This process is recursive but can be iteratively generated.

However, manually writing all 511 moves is error-prone. The example in the problem for 3 disks shows that the solution follows this iterative approach. Therefore, the correct answer is to generate all 511 moves following this pattern, ensuring each move is valid and the peg states are correctly updated.

Since the user requires the complete list, I will proceed to generate the moves in the specified format, starting from move 1 to move 511, ensuring each move's from_peg, to_peg, and the resulting peg states are correctly recorded. Each line must follow the format strictly, with move_id incrementing correctly and peg states represented as space-separated disk numbers from bottom to top.

Given the constraints, I'll generate the initial moves correctly and continue the pattern, ensuring that after each move, the peg states are accurately reflected. Any mistakes in intermediate steps must be corrected by redefining the move_id with the corrected values, as per the example provided.

This process will continue until all disks are on peg2, resulting in the goal configuration. The final move will place disk9 onto peg2, completing the puzzle.
