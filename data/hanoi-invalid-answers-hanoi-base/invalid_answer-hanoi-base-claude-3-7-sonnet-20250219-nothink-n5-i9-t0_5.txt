# Tower of Hanoi Solution for 5 Disks

I'll solve this Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 5 disks, moving all disks from peg 0 to peg 2.

## Solution Approach

The Tower of Hanoi has a recursive solution pattern. For 5 disks:
1. Move disks 1-4 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 5 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-4 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)

Let me work through the complete solution:

## Complete Solution (31 moves)

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2], [4, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0],
    [5, 0, 2], [1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2], [4, 1, 2], [1, 2, 0],
    [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 2, 2]
]
```

Each move is represented as [disk id, from peg, to peg]. For example, the first move [1, 0, 2] means "move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2".

This is the optimal solution with the minimum number of moves (2^5 - 1 = 31) required to solve the Tower of Hanoi with 5 disks.
