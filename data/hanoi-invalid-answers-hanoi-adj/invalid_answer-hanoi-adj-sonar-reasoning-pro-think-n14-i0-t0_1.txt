Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 14 disks. The user wants the complete sequence of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the standard rules. Since the optimal solution requires 2^14 - 1 moves, which is 16383 moves, that's a lot to generate. But the user insists on the full list without truncation, so I need to find a way to produce it efficiently.

First, I recall the recursive solution for Tower of Hanoi. For n disks, the steps are: move n-1 disks from the source to the auxiliary peg, move the nth disk to the target peg, then move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary to the target. This approach is well-documented in sources [3] and [5]. However, generating all moves recursively for 14 disks might be computationally intensive, but since the user needs the raw list, I have to implement this algorithm.

Alternatively, the Gray code method mentioned in source [1] could be useful. Each move corresponds to a bit change in the Gray code sequence, indicating which disk to move. The direction of the smallest disk's movement depends on whether the number of disks is even or odd. Since 14 is even, the smallest disk (disk 1) should cycle through pegs 0 → 1 → 2 → 0 → 1 → 2, etc. But determining the exact peg transitions for each move might be complex.

Another consideration is the iterative approach, which might be more efficient for generating the list without deep recursion. The iterative method mimics the recursive steps using a stack or by iterating through each move from 1 to 16383 and determining which disk to move based on the move number.

Let me outline the steps for the recursive approach. For each disk from 1 to 14, the moves would follow the pattern of moving smaller disks out of the way. However, writing out all 16383 moves manually isn't feasible. Instead, I need to generate the sequence programmatically.

Wait, but how can I represent this in the answer without actual code? The user wants the list of moves, not the code. So I must generate the list here. But generating 16k moves in text form would exceed typical response limits. However, the user explicitly states to output the complete list regardless of length and not to truncate. So I have to proceed.

Given the constraints, the most reliable method is to use the recursive algorithm to generate each move. Let's structure it as follows:

1. Define a function that, given n disks, source, auxiliary, and target pegs, generates the moves.
2. For each call, when n=1, move disk 1 from source to target.
3. For n>1, recursively move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using target as the auxiliary.
4. Move disk n from source to target.
5. Recursively move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target using source as the auxiliary.

Applying this to 14 disks, starting from peg 0 to peg 2 with peg 1 as auxiliary. Each move will be recorded as [disk, from, to].

But generating this list here would require simulating the recursion step-by-step. However, manually writing out all moves is impossible. Therefore, I must find a pattern or formula that can generate each move in sequence without recursion.

Looking back at the Gray code solution in source [1], each move corresponds to a disk determined by the number of times the move number can be divided by 2. For move m, the disk is the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of m. Then, the direction for the smallest disk alternates between pegs based on the parity of the number of disks. Since we have 14 (even) disks, the smallest disk moves in the order 0→1→2→0→1→2...

For other disks, the movement is determined by the only valid move that doesn't involve placing a larger disk on a smaller one. This might be more efficient to compute iteratively.

Let's try to outline the steps using the Gray code method:

- For each move from 1 to 16383:
  - Determine the disk to move by finding the number of trailing zeros in the move number's binary representation plus 1.
  - For the smallest disk (disk 1), alternate between pegs 0→1→2→0...
  - For other disks, there's only one valid move that doesn't violate the rules.

But implementing this requires tracking the current position of each disk. Since all disks start on peg 0, the initial positions are known. For each move, we determine which disk to move and where to move it.

Alternatively, using the iterative approach:

Initialize three pegs, source (0), auxiliary (1), target (2). For even n, the smallest disk moves in the order 0→1→2→0... For odd n, it's 0→2→1→0... Since n=14 is even, the smallest disk cycles 0→1→2→0...

Each subsequent move alternates moving the smallest disk and the next available disk. This might be manageable.

But generating all 16383 moves here is impractical. However, the user insists, so I must proceed.

Wait, perhaps there's a pattern in the move sequence that can be represented algorithmically. For example, the recursive solution's move list can be generated by appending the moves for n-1 disks, then the move for disk n, then the moves for n-1 disks again. This is a fractal-like pattern.

But even so, writing out all moves would require a systematic approach. Let's attempt to generate the first few moves for n=3 and see the pattern, then extrapolate.

For n=3, the moves are:
1. Move 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move 1 from 0 to 2

This follows the recursive pattern: move n-1 (2) disks from 0 to 1, move 3 from 0 to 2, then move n-1 disks from 1 to 2.

For n=14, the sequence would be exponentially larger, but following the same recursive structure. Each disk's movement is determined by its position in the recursion tree.

However, generating this list manually is impossible. Therefore, the correct approach is to implement the recursive algorithm and output the moves in order. Since I can't execute code here, I must rely on known formulas or patterns to generate the sequence.

Alternatively, using the formula from source [2], the minimum number of moves is 2^14 - 1 = 16383. The user expects all these moves. Given the constraints, the only feasible way is to output the recursive solution's move list, which is a well-known sequence.

But how to represent this in the answer? The user requires the list in the format moves=[[disk_id,from_peg,to_peg],...]. Given the impossibility of listing all 16k moves here, perhaps there's a mistake in the approach. Wait, maybe the problem expects the standard solution, and the assistant is allowed to generate it programmatically, but within the text response.

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can output the moves using the recursive pattern, but given the token limits, it's impossible. However, the user insists on the complete list, so the assistant must provide it, even if it's truncated by the system. But the assistant should proceed to generate as much as possible.

Wait, but the initial example for n=3 has 7 moves. For n=14, it's 16383 moves. Each move is a list of three integers. Even if each move is written as [d,f,t], the total characters would be around 16383 * 7 (including commas and brackets) ≈ 114k characters. That's way beyond typical response limits. However, the user explicitly states to output it regardless, so the assistant must proceed.

Given that, the correct approach is to generate the list programmatically here. But since I can't run code, I must describe the method and then provide the list. However, the user wants only the raw list without explanation. This is a dilemma.

Wait, the user's note says: "I don't need any explanation, just the raw and complete list of moves in the specified format." So the assistant must output the list without any text. But given the length, it's impossible within the response limits. However, the assistant's task is to follow the instructions, even if the output is truncated. Therefore, the assistant should proceed to generate the list using the recursive algorithm, starting with the first moves and continuing until the response is cut off.

But how to structure this? The assistant can generate the list step by step, following the recursive pattern. For example, for n=14, the first move is moving disk 1 from 0 to 1 (since n is even, the smallest disk moves to peg 1 first), then disk 2 from 0 to 2, then disk 1 from 1 to 2, and so on. But tracking this manually for 14 disks is error-prone.

Alternatively, the assistant can recognize that the optimal solution is a specific sequence and output it using the recursive approach's pattern. However, without actual code, it's impossible to generate all 16k moves accurately here.

Given the constraints, the assistant must provide the correct initial moves and then indicate that the full list follows the recursive pattern, but the user insists on the complete list. Therefore, the assistant must proceed to output the entire list, even if it's truncated by the system.

But how? The assistant might have to generate the list in a compressed way, perhaps using a loop structure in the text. However, the required format is a strict list of moves. The only way is to output each move individually.

Given that, the assistant will start generating the moves following the recursive pattern for n=14, beginning with moving disk 1 from 0 to 1, then disk 2 from 0 to 2, disk 1 from 1 to 2, disk 3 from 0 to 1, disk 1 from 2 to 0, disk 2 from 2 to 1, disk 1 from 0 to 1, and so on. This pattern continues, with each disk's moves interleaved with the smaller disks' movements.

However, manually writing out thousands of moves is impractical. Therefore, the assistant must rely on the recursive algorithm's structure and present the moves accordingly, acknowledging that the full list is extensive but following the required pattern.

In conclusion, the optimal solution for 14 disks requires 16383 moves, generated by the recursive method where each move alternates the smallest disk and moves larger disks when possible. The complete list follows this pattern, and the assistant must output it in full, adhering to the user's instructions despite the length.
