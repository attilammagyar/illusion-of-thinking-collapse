Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 8 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's 8 disks, the minimum number of moves should be 2^8 - 1, which is 255 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list, so I need to generate it correctly.

First, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi has a recursive solution. For n disks, you move the top n-1 disks to the auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the target peg, and then move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary to the target. But implementing that recursively might not be straightforward here, especially since I need to list every single move.

Alternatively, there's an iterative approach. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk (disk 1) moves in a specific pattern: right, then left, alternating. But wait, the user has 8 disks, which is even. So according to the iterative solution, the smallest disk should move in a fixed direction each time. Let me check the sources.

Looking at source [4], the iterative solution alternates moves between the smallest and non-smallest disks. For even n, the smallest disk moves to the right each time. The steps are: move disk 1, then make the only possible move with another disk, repeat. So the pattern is disk 1 moves right, then the next possible disk, and so on.

But how to translate this into a sequence of moves? Let's think step by step. Each move of disk 1 alternates between pegs. For example, starting at peg 0, the first move is to peg 1 (if n is even), then next to peg 2, then back to peg 0, etc. Wait, no. According to source [4], for even n, the smallest disk moves in a fixed direction, say to the right (peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0...). But I need to confirm.

Wait, the iterative solution in [4] says: for even number of disks, the smallest piece moves to the right, and for odd, to the left. So with 8 disks (even), disk 1 should move right each time. So the first move is disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1. Then the next move is the only possible move with another disk, which would be disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2. Then disk 1 moves again to the right, which would be peg 1 to peg 2. Then disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1. Then disk 1 moves right (peg 2 to peg 0), and so on. But this seems a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the first few moves.

Wait, maybe it's better to follow the iterative algorithm step by step. The iterative solution for even n (8) would involve moving disk 1 in a specific pattern. Let's refer to source [5], which gives a step-by-step for the solution. In [5], they mention an algorithm where for even disks, you move disk 1 to the right each time. Let's see their example:

In their solution steps, for even disks, the initial move is disk 1 to the right. Then move the next available disk (disk 2), then disk 1 again, etc. So following that pattern, the sequence would be:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2.
... and so on.

But this is for 4 disks. For 8 disks, the pattern continues similarly, but the sequence becomes much longer. Each time a new even-numbered disk is moved, the pattern repeats. The challenge is to generate all 255 moves correctly without missing any steps.

Alternatively, using the recursive approach, the moves can be generated by breaking down the problem. For 8 disks, the steps would be:

1. Move the top 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary.
2. Move disk 8 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move the 7 disks from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary.

Each of these steps involves recursive subproblems. For example, moving 7 disks requires moving 6 disks first, etc. But translating this recursion into an explicit list of moves is tedious but systematic.

However, generating the exact sequence manually would be error-prone. Instead, perhaps there's a pattern or formula to determine each move. For example, in the iterative approach, the moves alternate between moving the smallest disk and the next possible disk. The direction of the smallest disk's move depends on whether the total number of disks is even or odd.

Given that the user has 8 disks (even), the smallest disk (1) moves in a cyclic manner to the right: peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0, etc. The other moves are determined by the only legal move available that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

So the algorithm would be:

- While the puzzle isn't solved:
   - Move the smallest disk (1) to the next peg in the direction (right for even n).
   - Make the only possible move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

This alternates between moving disk 1 and another disk. Each time, after moving disk 1, there's only one possible move for another disk, which is determined by the current positions.

To generate the list, I can simulate this process step by step. Let's try to outline the first few moves to see the pattern.

Initial state: Peg 0 has [8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], pegs 1 and 2 are empty.

Move 1: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (smallest disk moves right).
Move 2: Move the next possible disk. The available disks are 2-8 on peg 0. The only legal move is disk 2 to peg 2 (since peg 2 is empty).
Move 3: Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2 (right again).
Move 4: Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1 (since peg 1 has disk 1, which is smaller than 3, so can't place there. Wait, no. Wait, after move 3, peg 2 has disks 1 and 2. Peg 1 is empty. So disk 3 can move to peg 1 (empty) or peg 2 (which has smaller disks). Wait, disk 3 can't go on top of disk 2. So the only legal move is disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1.
Move 4: disk 3 to peg 1.
Move 5: Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0 (since we're moving right, but after peg 2, the next right is peg 0? Wait, the direction is cyclic. For even n, the direction is right, so after peg 2, the next right is peg 0. So disk 1 moves from peg 2 to peg 0.
Move 5: disk 1 to peg 0.
Move 6: Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1 (since disk 2 is smaller than disk 3 on peg 1, so it can be placed there).
Move 6: disk 2 to peg 1.
Move 7: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (right direction: peg 0 → peg 1).
Move 7: disk 1 to peg 1.
Move 8: Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2 (since peg 2 has no disks, so it's legal).
... and this continues.

Each time after moving disk 1, the next move is the only possible one that doesn't involve disk 1. This pattern continues until all disks are on peg 2.

To generate the entire list, I need to simulate each move step by step, ensuring that each move is legal and follows the rules. However, doing this manually for 255 steps is impractical. Instead, I can use a known algorithm or formula to generate the sequence.

Another approach is to note that each disk's moves follow a specific pattern. For example, disk 1 moves every other move, disk 2 moves every 4th move, disk 3 every 8th, etc. The direction of each disk's moves depends on its position in the sequence. However, this might be more complex.

Alternatively, using the recursive approach, the sequence can be generated by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. For 8 disks, the moves would be:

- Move disks 1-7 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary).
- Move disk 8 from peg 0 to peg 2.
- Move disks 1-7 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).

Each of these steps involves recursive moves. For example, moving 7 disks requires moving 6 disks first, and so on. This recursive breakdown can be translated into a sequence of moves.

However, generating this sequence requires keeping track of the source, target, and auxiliary pegs at each recursive step. For each move of a disk, the source and target pegs depend on the current subproblem.

Given the complexity, perhaps the most reliable way is to implement the iterative algorithm, which alternates between moving the smallest disk and the next possible disk. Since the user needs the complete list, I'll need to generate each move step by step, following the iterative approach for even n.

Let me outline the steps more systematically:

1. Initialize pegs: peg0 = [8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], peg1 = [], peg2 = [].
2. Determine the direction for the smallest disk (even n → right).
3. While the goal is not achieved:
   a. Move the smallest disk (1) in the current direction.
   b. Make the only possible move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

The direction for the smallest disk is right (peg0 → peg1 → peg2 → peg0...).

Now, simulating this step by step:

Move 1: disk1 from peg0 to peg1.
Move 2: move the only possible non-disk1 move. The available disks are disk2 on peg0. Can it move to peg2? Yes, since peg2 is empty. So move disk2 from peg0 to peg2.
Move 3: disk1 from peg1 to peg2 (right direction).
Move 4: move non-disk1. The available disks are disk3 on peg0. Can it move to peg1 (since peg1 is empty). Yes. Move disk3 from peg0 to peg1.
Move 5: disk1 from peg2 to peg0 (right direction: peg2 → peg0).
Move 6: move non-disk1. Disk2 is on peg2. Can it move to peg1 (which has disk3). Disk2 < disk3, so yes. Move disk2 from peg2 to peg1.
Move 7: disk1 from peg0 to peg1 (right direction: peg0 → peg1).
Move 8: move non-disk1. Disk4 on peg0 can move to peg2 (empty). Move disk4 from peg0 to peg2.
Move 9: disk1 from peg1 to peg2 (right direction: peg1 → peg2).
Move 10: move non-disk1. Disk2 on peg1 can move to peg0 (since peg0 has disk1, but disk2 > disk1, so no. Alternatively, disk2 can move to peg2, which has disk4. Disk2 < disk4, so yes. Move disk2 from peg1 to peg2.
Move 11: disk1 from peg2 to peg0 (right direction: peg2 → peg0).
Move 12: move non-disk1. Disk3 on peg1 can move to peg2 (disk3 < disk4). Move disk3 from peg1 to peg2.
Move 13: disk1 from peg0 to peg1 (right direction: peg0 → peg1).
Move 14: move non-disk1. Disk2 on peg2 can move to peg1 (disk2 < disk3 on peg2? Wait, peg2 has disk4, disk3, disk2. Wait, after move 12, peg2 has disk4, then disk3 was moved there, so peg2 has [4,3]. Then disk2 is moved to peg2 in move 10, making it [4,3,2]. Then in move 12, disk3 is moved from peg1 to peg2, but wait, after move 10, peg1 has disk3? Let me retrace:

Wait, after move 7: peg1 has disk1 and disk2? No, let's retrace the moves up to move 8:

Move 1: peg0: [8,7,6,5,4,3,2], peg1: [1], peg2: []
Move 2: peg0: [8,7,6,5,4,3], peg1: [1], peg2: [2]
Move 3: peg0: [8,7,6,5,4,3], peg1: [], peg2: [2,1]
Move 4: peg0: [8,7,6,5,4], peg1: [3], peg2: [2,1]
Move 5: peg0: [8,7,6,5,4,1], peg1: [3], peg2: [2]
Move 6: peg0: [8,7,6,5,4,1], peg1: [3,2], peg2: []
Move 7: peg0: [8,7,6,5,4], peg1: [3,2,1], peg2: []
Move 8: peg0: [8,7,6,5], peg1: [3,2,1], peg2: [4]
Move 9: peg0: [8,7,6,5], peg1: [3,2], peg2: [4,1]
Move 10: peg0: [8,7,6,5], peg1: [3], peg2: [4,1,2]
Move 11: peg0: [8,7,6,5,1], peg1: [3], peg2: [4,2]
Move 12: peg0: [8,7,6,5,1], peg1: [], peg2: [4,2,3]
Move 13: peg0: [8,7,6,5], peg1: [1], peg2: [4,2,3]
Move 14: move non-disk1. The available disks are disk2 on peg2 (which is under disk3). Wait, peg2 has [4,2,3]? No, wait, after move 12, peg2 has disk4, then in move 12, disk3 is moved from peg1 to peg2. So peg2 would have [4,3], and disk2 is on peg1? Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me track each move carefully.

This manual simulation is error-prone, especially for 255 moves. Therefore, it's better to rely on a known algorithm or formula to generate the sequence correctly.

Another approach is to note that each disk's moves follow a specific pattern. For example, disk 1 moves every 2 moves, disk 2 every 4 moves, disk 3 every 8 moves, etc. The direction of each disk's moves alternates based on its position. For even-numbered disks, the direction is different from odd-numbered ones. However, this might not hold for all cases.

Alternatively, using the binary representation of the move numbers can determine which disk to move. Each move corresponds to a binary digit, and the position of the rightmost zero determines the disk to move. But this might be more complex.

Given the time constraints and the need for accuracy, the best approach is to implement the iterative algorithm for even n (8 disks) and generate each move step by step, ensuring that each move is legal.

However, since I can't actually run code here, I need to rely on the sources provided. Source [5] provides a step-by-step for the solution, mentioning that for even disks, the algorithm involves moving disk 1 to the right each time and alternating with other disks. They mention that after each run of the algorithm, you repeat the process until solved.

Given that the minimum number of moves is 255, and the user insists on the complete list, I need to generate all 255 moves. But doing this manually is impossible. Therefore, I must recall that the recursive solution's move sequence can be generated by a specific pattern.

The recursive solution for moving n disks from source to target using auxiliary is:

- Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.
- Move nth disk from source to target.
- Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target.

For n=8, this would involve moving 7 disks to peg1, then disk8 to peg2, then 7 disks from peg1 to peg2. Each of these steps is recursive.

The move sequence can be generated by this recursion. Each time a disk is moved, it's either the base case (n=1) or part of a larger move.

For example, the moves for n=3 would be:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move 1 from 0 to 2

Which matches the example given in the user's query.

Extending this to n=8, the sequence would follow the same pattern but with many more steps. Each time a disk is moved, it's part of moving a larger stack.

However, generating this sequence requires knowing the exact order of moves, which is complex. But since the user provided sources, perhaps source [5] gives a pattern. Source [5] mentions an algorithm where you move disk 1 to the right, then the next available disk, and repeat. They also mention that for even disks, the algorithm is slightly different.

In their example, for even disks, the algorithm starts with moving disk 1 to the right, then the next disk, etc. Following this, the sequence can be generated by alternating between moving disk 1 and the next possible disk.

Given that the user needs the complete list, and considering the sources, the correct approach is to follow the iterative algorithm for even n, which produces the optimal 255 moves.

Therefore, the final answer is the complete list of 255 moves generated by this iterative approach. Each move alternates between moving disk 1 to the right and the only possible move of another disk. The exact sequence is long, but following this pattern ensures correctness.
