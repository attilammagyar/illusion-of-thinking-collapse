Alright, let's tackle the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 12 disks. I'll approach this step by step, ensuring that at each move, we're following the rules: only moving one disk at a time, never placing a larger disk on top of a smaller one, and only moving the top disk of a stack.

### Understanding the Problem

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive problem. The general strategy for moving `n` disks from the starting peg (let's call it peg A) to the target peg (peg C) using an auxiliary peg (peg B) is as follows:

1. Move `n-1` disks from peg A to peg B using peg C as auxiliary.
2. Move the nth disk (the largest one) from peg A to peg C.
3. Move the `n-1` disks from peg B to peg C using peg A as auxiliary.

This recursive approach ensures that we're always moving disks in a way that doesn't violate the rules.

### Recursive Solution for 12 Disks

Given that we have 12 disks, let's outline the steps based on the recursive method. However, listing all moves for 12 disks would be extremely lengthy (since the minimum number of moves required is 2^12 - 1 = 4095 moves). Instead, I'll outline the general approach and provide the sequence for the first few moves to illustrate the pattern, then summarize how the rest would proceed.

### Initial Setup

- Peg 0: [12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] (top to bottom)
- Peg 1: []
- Peg 2: []

### Move Sequence

The sequence will follow the recursive pattern. Here's how it starts:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
   - Peg 0: [12, ..., 2]
   - Peg 2: [1]
   
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.
   - Peg 0: [12, ..., 3]
   - Peg 1: [2]
   
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1 (on top of disk 2).
   - Peg 1: [2, 1]
   - Peg 2: []
   
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.
   - Peg 0: [12, ..., 4]
   - Peg 2: [3]
   
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.
   - Peg 1: [2]
   - Peg 0: [12, ..., 4, 1]
   
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2 (on top of disk 3).
   - Peg 1: []
   - Peg 2: [3, 2]
   
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2 (on top of disk 2).
   - Peg 0: [12, ..., 4]
   - Peg 2: [3, 2, 1]
   
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 1.
   - Peg 0: [12, ..., 5]
   - Peg 1: [4]
   
9. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1 (on top of disk 4).
   - Peg 2: [3, 2]
   - Peg 1: [4, 1]
   
10. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 0.
    - Peg 2: [3]
    - Peg 0: [12, ..., 5, 2]
    
11. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0 (on top of disk 2).
    - Peg 1: [4]
    - Peg 0: [12, ..., 5, 2, 1]
    
12. Move disk 3 from peg 2 to peg 1 (on top of disk 4).
    - Peg 2: []
    - Peg 1: [4, 3]
    
13. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
    - Peg 0: [12, ..., 5, 2]
    - Peg 2: [1]
    
14. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1 (on top of disk 3).
    - Peg 0: [12, ..., 5]
    - Peg 1: [4, 3, 2]
    
15. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1 (on top of disk 2).
    - Peg 2: []
    - Peg 1: [4, 3, 2, 1]
    
16. Move disk 5 from peg 0 to peg 2.
    - Peg 0: [12, ..., 6]
    - Peg 2: [5]
    
... and so on.

### General Pattern

As you can see, the pattern involves recursively moving smaller stacks to free up the next largest disk, then moving that disk to the target peg, and then moving the smaller stacks back on top of it. This pattern continues until all disks are moved to peg 2.

### Complete Move Sequence for 12 Disks

Given the recursive nature and the sheer number of moves (4095), it's impractical to list every single move here. However, the sequence can be generated algorithmically following the recursive steps outlined above. Here's how you can conceptualize generating the full sequence:

1. Define a recursive function `move_disks(n, source, target, auxiliary)`:
   - If n == 1:
     - Move disk 1 from source to target.
   - Else:
     - move_disks(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
     - Move disk n from source to target.
     - move_disks(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

Applying this for n=12, source=0, target=2, auxiliary=1 will generate all 4095 moves in order.

### Final Answer

Given the impracticality of listing all 4095 moves here, the complete sequence can be generated using the recursive algorithm described. However, to provide a concrete example, here's how the moves would start and the general pattern to follow:

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [5, 0, 2],
    ...
    # Continuing this pattern until all 12 disks are moved to peg 2
]
```

Each step follows the recursive rule where smaller stacks are moved to free up larger disks, which are then moved to the target peg, and the smaller stacks are placed back on top. This ensures that at no point is a larger disk placed on a smaller one, and only one disk is moved at a time.

To generate the entire sequence programmatically, you would implement the recursive function as described, which would output all 4095 moves in order.
