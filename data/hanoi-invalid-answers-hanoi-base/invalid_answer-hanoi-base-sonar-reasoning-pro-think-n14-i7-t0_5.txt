Okay, I need to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 14 disks. Let me start by recalling the standard solution for Tower of Hanoi. The problem involves moving all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules that only one disk can be moved at a time and a larger disk can't be placed on a smaller one.

First, I remember that the minimal number of moves required is 2^n - 1, where n is the number of disks. For 14 disks, that's 2^14 - 1 = 16383 moves. That's a lot, but the user wants the sequence of moves, which is going to be a long list. However, generating all those moves manually isn't feasible, so I need to find a pattern or algorithm that can be applied recursively or iteratively.

From the search results, the iterative solution mentioned in [2] says to alternate moves between the smallest disk and a non-smallest disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific direction. Since 14 is even, the initial direction for the smallest disk (disk 1) should be to the right. The iterative approach involves repeating a sequence of steps: moving the smallest disk, then the next possible disk, and so on.

Looking at the example in [1], with 3 disks, the moves are structured in a certain way. The solution for 3 disks takes 7 moves. The provided example moves disk 1 first, then disk 2, then disk 1 again, and so on. This aligns with the recursive approach where the problem is broken down into moving n-1 disks, then the nth disk, then n-1 again.

But for 14 disks, a recursive approach would generate the correct sequence, but writing out all 16383 moves isn't practical. However, the user's query specifically asks for the complete list of moves in the format [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]. So I need to find a way to generate this sequence programmatically or through a pattern.

The iterative solution from [2] mentions that for an even number of disks, the stack ends up on peg C (which is peg 2 in this case). The steps involve moving the smallest disk in a specific direction each time. The algorithm alternates between moving the smallest disk and the next available disk. 

Another point from [5] is that for an even number of disks, the initial move is to the left. Wait, in [5], they mention that for the "odd" algorithm, you move disk 1 to the left, but for even, maybe it's different. Wait, the user's case has 14 disks, which is even. The solution in [2] says that if the number of disks is even, the smallest disk moves to the right first. So the direction alternates based on the parity.

The iterative approach steps are:

1. Move the smallest disk to the next peg in the direction (right for even, left for odd).
2. Make the only legal move not involving the smallest disk.
3. Repeat until all disks are on the target peg.

Since 14 is even, the direction for the smallest disk is right (peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0...). Each time the smallest disk is moved, it's in this cyclic direction. The non-smallest moves are determined by the only legal move available.

But how to translate this into a sequence of moves for 14 disks? It's going to be a repetitive pattern. Each move of the smallest disk alternates with a move of the next possible disk. However, manually listing all 16383 steps isn't feasible here. But perhaps the user expects the general algorithm or a way to generate the moves, or maybe a recursive breakdown.

Wait, the example given for 3 disks in the query has a specific move sequence. Let me check that example again. The example moves are:

moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]

This follows the standard Tower of Hanoi solution. For 3 disks, the recursive approach is to move the top 2 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, then move disk 3 to peg 2, then move the 2 disks from peg 1 to peg 2. The example's moves correspond to that.

So for 14 disks, the recursive approach would involve moving the top 13 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, then moving disk 14 to peg 2, then moving the 13 disks from peg 1 to peg 2. Each of those 13-disk moves would themselves be broken down into smaller steps.

But generating the entire sequence would require implementing the recursive algorithm. However, since the user is asking for the complete list of moves, perhaps the answer should provide the recursive method to generate the moves, even if the actual list is too long to write out here. Alternatively, maybe the answer can provide the algorithm and note that the full list is extensive but follows this pattern.

Wait, the user's query specifies "Find the sequence of moves" and provides an example for 3 disks. They expect the actual list of moves for 14 disks. But given that 14 disks require 16383 moves, it's impossible to list them all here. However, perhaps the answer should explain the pattern and provide the algorithm to generate the moves, along with the first few and last few moves as an example, citing the sources that explain the method.

But looking at the search results, [2] mentions the iterative solution, and [5] talks about an algorithm for even and odd numbers. Since 14 is even, the algorithm from [5] might be applicable. For even disks, the initial move is to the left, but in the example from [1], the direction depends on the parity. Wait, in [2], it says that for an even number of disks, the stack ends up on peg C (peg 2 in this case), which is the target. The iterative solution steps are:

- Move the smallest disk in a specific direction (right for even).
- Then make the only legal move possible that doesn't involve the smallest disk.
- Repeat.

So the moves alternate between moving the smallest disk and another disk. The direction for the smallest disk is cyclic: for even n, it's peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0, etc.

But how to translate this into a list of moves? Each move of the smallest disk is in the direction, then the next move is the only possible legal move of a non-smallest disk. For example, after moving disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1, the next move is to move the smallest available disk that's not 1, which would be disk 2, but only if it's legal. Wait, no, the next move after moving the smallest is to make the only legal move that doesn't involve the smallest disk. So after moving disk 1, the next move is between pegs 0 and 2, whichever is legal.

This is a bit complex. Let's try to outline the first few moves for 14 disks to see the pattern.

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (smallest disk, even n, direction right).
2. Move the next possible disk: between pegs 0 and 2. The top of peg 0 is disk 2, and peg 2 is empty. So move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.
4. Move the next possible disk: between pegs 0 and 1. The top of peg 0 is disk 3, and peg 1 is empty. So move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2.
... and so on.

This pattern continues, with the smallest disk moving right each time (peg 0→1→2→0...), and the other moves following the legal options. However, generating all 16383 moves manually is impractical. Therefore, the answer should explain the algorithm and perhaps provide a way to generate the moves programmatically, citing the sources that describe the iterative or recursive method.

But the user's example for 3 disks shows the full move list. Maybe the answer should provide the recursive approach's move list, even though it's lengthy. However, given the constraints, perhaps the answer should outline the method and note that the full sequence follows the standard Tower of Hanoi solution, which can be generated using a recursive algorithm, and then provide the complete list in the required format. But given the length, that's not feasible here. 

Wait, the user's query is asking for the sequence of moves, so perhaps the answer needs to provide it, even if it's very long. However, in the context of this platform, providing a 16k-line answer isn't practical. Therefore, the answer should explain the method to generate the moves and perhaps provide a snippet of the sequence, indicating that the full list follows the same pattern.

Alternatively, since the problem is about 14 disks, which is even, and the target peg is 2, the iterative solution from [2] applies. The answer can outline the steps of the iterative algorithm and how it generates the moves, then provide the complete list in the required format. However, without actual code or a generated list, it's impossible to write out all moves here. 

But the user's example for 3 disks includes the full move list. Maybe the expectation is to apply the same logic for 14 disks. However, generating that manually is impossible. Therefore, the answer must describe the method and perhaps provide a way to generate the moves, citing the sources that explain the algorithm.

In conclusion, the correct approach is to use the standard Tower of Hanoi recursive algorithm, which for n disks involves:

1. Move n-1 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2 as auxiliary.
2. Move disk n from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move n-1 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary.

This recursive approach generates the minimal number of moves. For 14 disks, applying this recursively would produce the correct sequence. However, the actual list of moves is too long to write here, but the answer can outline the algorithm and provide the first few and last few moves as an example, explaining the pattern.

Alternatively, the answer can state that the sequence follows the standard solution and provide the recursive formula, but given the user's example, they expect the actual list. Since that's impractical, perhaps the answer should include a Python function that generates the moves and then outputs the list, but in the context of this platform, code might not be allowed unless requested.

Wait, the user's query is part of the system prompt's personalization section, which is a puzzle they want solved. The user provided an example for 3 disks and expects a similar list for 14. Given that, perhaps the answer should provide the recursive algorithm's move list, even if it's represented in a formulaic way. However, without actual code, it's not possible to generate all 16383 moves here. Therefore, the answer must explain the method and note that the full list can be generated programmatically using the recursive approach, citing the sources [2] and [4], which discuss the recursive solution.

But the user's requirements state: "When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding complete list of moves." So the assistant is expected to provide the complete list. However, with 14 disks, that's 16383 moves. It's impossible to list them all here. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. Perhaps the user is testing the assistant's ability to generate the algorithm rather than the actual list. Alternatively, maybe the example provided is for 3 disks, and the user expects a similar structured answer but for 14, but given the length, it's impractical.

Wait, looking back at the search results, [3] is a video showing the solution for 14 disks, but the content isn't detailed. [1] explains the solution for 4 disks, showing the moves step by step. [2] provides the iterative solution steps. [4] mentions the recursive approach. [5] describes an algorithm for even and odd disks.

Given that, the answer should outline the iterative algorithm for even n (14) and explain how each move is generated, perhaps providing the first few moves as an example, and then note that the pattern continues for all 16383 moves. The complete list can be generated by following the iterative steps, moving the smallest disk in the right direction each time and making the only legal non-smallest move alternately.

Therefore, the answer will describe the iterative method, provide the initial moves, and explain how the pattern continues, citing the sources. The complete list of moves follows this algorithm, but due to its length, it's not feasible to list all here. However, the user's example includes the full list for 3 disks, so perhaps the assistant is expected to generate it programmatically. But without executing code, the assistant can't produce the list. Therefore, the answer must explain the method and refer to the sources that provide the algorithm.

The Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 14 disks requires 16,383 moves following the minimal solution. The sequence follows an **iterative pattern** optimized for even-numbered disk counts, where the smallest disk (disk 1) moves cyclically to the right (peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0...), alternating with the only legal non-smallest disk move. Here’s how the solution unfolds:

### Key Algorithmic Steps for 14 Disks:
1. **Direction for smallest disk**: Since 14 is even, disk 1 moves rightward initially (peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → ...).
2. **Alternating moves**: After each move of disk 1, make the only legal move involving the next-smallest available disk.
3. **Cycle repetition**: Continue alternating until all disks are on peg 2.

### Example Initial Moves:
```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 1],  # Disk 1 to peg 1
    [2, 0, 2],  # Disk 2 to peg 2
    [1, 1, 2],  # Disk 1 to peg 2
    [3, 0, 1],  # Disk 3 to peg 1
    [1, 2, 0],  # Disk 1 to peg 0
    [2, 2, 1],  # Disk 2 to peg 1
    [1, 0, 1],  # Disk 1 to peg 1
    [4, 0, 2],  # Disk 4 to peg 2
    ...
]
```
This pattern repeats, with disk 1 cycling rightward and larger disks moving to intermediate pegs as needed. The full sequence adheres to the **2<sup>n</sup> − 1 formula** [2][4], ensuring no larger disk is ever placed atop a smaller one.

### Final Moves (Last 3 Steps):
```
...
    [1, 0, 1],  # Disk 1 to peg 1
    [2, 0, 2],  # Disk 2 to peg 2
    [1, 1, 2]   # Disk 1 to peg 2 (final move)
]
```

The complete solution can be generated programmatically using a **recursive** or **iterative algorithm** [2][5]. For implementation, see the iterative logic in [2] or recursive breakdown in [4].
