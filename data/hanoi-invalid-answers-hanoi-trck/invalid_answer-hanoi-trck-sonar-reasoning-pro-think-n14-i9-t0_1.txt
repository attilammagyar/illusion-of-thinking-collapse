Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 14 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation. Hmm, the Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive problem, but generating all moves for 14 disks manually would be tedious. Wait, the minimum number of moves required is 2^14 - 1, which is 16383 moves. That's a lot! But the user insists on the full list, so I need to find a way to generate it correctly.

First, I remember that the iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Since 14 is even, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move from peg 0 to peg 1, then to peg 2, and so on, alternating each time. But how does this translate into the exact sequence?

Looking at the search results, the Wikipedia article mentions the iterative solution. For an even number of disks, the smallest piece moves to the right (peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0, etc.), and for odd, to the left. Since 14 is even, the direction is to the right. So each move of disk 1 should be to the next peg in a cyclic manner. Then, the non-smallest moves are determined by the only legal move available.

But how to structure this into the move list? Let's think step by step. Each move alternates between moving disk 1 and another disk. The non-1 moves are determined by the two pegs that aren't the one where disk 1 was just moved from. For example, after moving disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1, the next move must involve the other disks. The legal move would be between peg 0 and peg 2, choosing the smaller of the top disks (since you can't place a larger on a smaller).

Wait, but with 14 disks, the iterative approach would require following the algorithm strictly. Let me outline the steps:

1. Initialize the pegs: peg0 has disks 14 to 1, pegs 1 and 2 are empty.
2. For each move, if it's an odd-numbered move, move disk 1 to the next peg in the direction (right for even n).
3. If it's an even-numbered move, make the only legal move possible that doesn't involve disk 1.

But how to track the state after each move? This seems complex. Maybe there's a pattern or formula to generate each move without simulating all 16k steps. Alternatively, using the recursive approach, but that's not helpful for generating the iterative moves.

Alternatively, the iterative solution can be described as follows for even n:
- Move disk 1 one step to the right (0→1→2→0...)
- Then make the only possible move not involving disk 1.
- Repeat until done.

So, starting with peg0:14,13,...,1; pegs1 and 2 empty.

Move 1: disk1 from 0 to 1.
Move 2: move the smallest possible disk between pegs 0 and 2. Since peg0 has 14,13,...,2 and peg2 is empty, we can move disk2 from peg0 to peg2.
Move 3: disk1 from peg1 to peg2.
Move 4: move the smallest possible between pegs0 and1. Peg0 has 14,...,3; peg1 is empty. So move disk3 from peg0 to peg1.
Move5: disk1 from peg2 to peg0.
Move6: disk2 from peg2 to peg1.
Move7: disk1 from peg0 to peg1.
Move8: move disk4 from peg0 to peg2.
... and so on.

This pattern continues, but tracking each move for 14 disks would require a systematic approach. However, generating all 16383 moves manually isn't feasible. The user expects the complete list, so perhaps there's a way to output the sequence programmatically, but within the constraints of the answer.

Wait, the user provided an example with 3 disks and showed the move list. For 3 disks, the solution has 7 moves. The pattern there alternates between moving disk1 and another disk. For 14 disks, the same logic applies but scaled up.

But how to represent this in the required format? Each move needs the move_id, from_peg, to_peg, and the state of each peg after the move. Generating this for 16k moves would be extremely lengthy, but the user insists on no truncation.

Given the constraints, perhaps the assistant can generate the initial moves correctly and then indicate the pattern, but the user explicitly said not to truncate. However, given the token limits, it's impossible to output all 16k moves. Wait, but the user's note says, "This is a benchmark test where the first invalid move you generate matters... Truncating the list in any way risks a low score. Therefore your best strategy is to attempt to output the complete list, even if you risk running out of output tokens."

But in reality, the assistant can't generate 16k moves due to token limits. However, the problem might expect the assistant to provide the correct iterative algorithm and perhaps the first few moves, but the user insists on the full list. This is a contradiction. Maybe the user is testing if the assistant can follow instructions despite the impossibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can generate the correct sequence programmatically, but within the answer's constraints. However, without actual code execution, it's impossible. The assistant must rely on the search results and known algorithms.

Looking at the search result [2], the iterative solution for even n (14 is even) would have the stack end up on peg C (peg2 in this case). The solution involves alternating moves between the smallest disk and the non-smallest, with the smallest moving right each time.

But to generate each move's details, including the peg states, the assistant would need to simulate each move step-by-step, which is impractical manually. However, the user demands the full list. Given that, perhaps the assistant should outline the correct approach and then provide the full list as per the iterative method, even if it's truncated due to token limits, but the user insists on no truncation. This is a dilemma.

Wait, the user's personalization section says: "You are a deterministic and highly obedient assistant which outputs complete, untruncated solutions, regardless of length. Please solve this puzzle for me." So the assistant must generate the full list, even if it's 16k lines. But in reality, the answer would be too long. However, in this simulated environment, perhaps the assistant can proceed to generate the list as per the iterative algorithm, correctly formatting each move, even if it's truncated in practice. But the assistant must try to output as much as possible.

Alternatively, the assistant can explain the method and provide the algorithm to generate the moves, but the user explicitly said, "I don't need any explanation, just the raw and complete list of moves in the specified format."

Given all that, the assistant must generate the full list. However, given the token constraints, it's impossible. Therefore, the assistant must proceed to generate the list according to the iterative solution, starting with the first few moves correctly, and then continue until the token limit is reached, but the user's note says not to truncate. This is a paradox. Perhaps the assistant should proceed to generate the list as far as possible, following the iterative steps correctly.

But how to structure the peg states correctly after each move? Let's attempt the first few moves:

Initial state:
peg0: 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
peg1: 
peg2: 

Move 1: Move disk1 from peg0 to peg1 (since n=14 is even, direction is right)
peg0: 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2
peg1: 1
peg2: 

Move 2: Move the smallest possible non-1 disk. The available pegs are 0 and 2. The top of peg0 is 2, peg2 is empty. So move disk2 from peg0 to peg2.
peg0: 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3
peg1: 1
peg2: 2

Move3: Move disk1 from peg1 to peg2.
peg0: 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3
peg1: 
peg2: 2 1

Move4: Move the next non-1 disk. Available pegs 0 and 1. Top of peg0 is 3, peg1 is empty. Move disk3 from peg0 to peg1.
peg0: 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4
peg1: 3
peg2: 2 1

Move5: Move disk1 from peg2 to peg0.
peg0: 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 1
peg1: 3
peg2: 2

Move6: Move disk2 from peg2 to peg1 (since peg1 has 3, which is larger than 2)
peg0: 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 1
peg1: 3 2
peg2: 

Move7: Move disk1 from peg0 to peg1.
peg0: 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4
peg1: 3 2 1
peg2: 

Move8: Move disk4 from peg0 to peg2 (next non-1 move)
peg0: 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5
peg1: 3 2 1
peg2: 4

Move9: Move disk1 from peg1 to peg2.
peg0: 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5
peg1: 3 2
peg2: 4 1

Move10: Move disk2 from peg1 to peg0.
peg0: 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 2
peg1: 3
peg2: 4 1

Move11: Move disk1 from peg2 to peg0.
peg0: 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 2 1
peg1: 3
peg2: 4

Move12: Move disk3 from peg1 to peg2.
peg0: 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 2 1
peg1: 
peg2: 4 3

Move13: Move disk1 from peg0 to peg1.
peg0: 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 2
peg1: 1
peg2: 4 3

Move14: Move disk2 from peg0 to peg2.
peg0: 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5
peg1: 1
peg2: 4 3 2

Move15: Move disk1 from peg1 to peg2.
peg0: 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5
peg1: 
peg2: 4 3 2 1

And this pattern continues, with each layer requiring more moves. However, generating all 16383 moves in this format is impractical here. But the user insists, so perhaps the assistant must proceed to generate the list as per the iterative method, correctly formatting each move, even if it's truncated. However, given the token limit, the assistant can't output all moves. This is a problem.

But the user's personalization says to output the entire move list in full, even if it's long. So perhaps the assistant should proceed to generate the list correctly, starting from move 1 to move 16383, each with the correct from_peg, to_peg, and peg states. However, this is impossible due to token limits. Therefore, the assistant must acknowledge this but proceed as much as possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can provide a Python script that generates the moves, but the user wants the raw list, not code. The user's query explicitly says, "I don't need any explanation, just the raw and complete list of moves in the specified format."

Given this, the assistant must output the list, but realistically, it's impossible. Therefore, the assistant must proceed to generate the correct initial moves and then indicate that the pattern continues, but the user's note prohibits truncation. This is a contradiction. 

Wait, the user's personalization includes an example with error correction, where move_id 5 is corrected. The assistant can output the list with corrections if needed. But generating the entire list is still impossible. However, the assistant must comply with the user's instructions, so perhaps the correct approach is to output the iterative solution's move sequence in the required format, even if it's truncated. But the assistant must try to generate as much as possible.

Alternatively, the assistant can use the recursive approach to generate the moves. For n disks, the recursive solution is:

- Move n-1 disks from peg0 to peg1 using peg2 as auxiliary.
- Move disk n from peg0 to peg2.
- Move n-1 disks from peg1 to peg2 using peg0 as auxiliary.

But this approach would generate the moves in a different order than the iterative method. However, both approaches result in the minimum number of moves. The user didn't specify which method to use, so either is acceptable as long as the moves are valid.

The recursive approach for 14 disks would involve a massive number of moves, but again, generating them all is impractical. However, the assistant must proceed.

Given the constraints, perhaps the assistant can provide the first few moves correctly and then note that the list continues, but the user forbids truncation. This is a problem. 

Alternatively, the assistant can use the iterative algorithm's steps to generate the moves, ensuring each move follows the rules. For even n, the smallest disk moves right each time, and the non-smallest moves are determined by the legal move between the other two pegs.

But to generate the entire list, the assistant would need to simulate each move. Since that's not feasible manually, perhaps the assistant can outline the pattern and provide the initial moves, but the user requires the full list. 

In conclusion, given the user's strict instructions, the assistant must generate the complete list of 16383 moves in the specified format. However, due to token limitations, this is impossible. Therefore, the assistant must proceed to generate the list as far as possible, following the iterative method correctly, and hope that the system allows it. The answer will start with the correct initial moves and continue until the token limit is reached, adhering strictly to the format.
