Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to move all disks from peg 0 to peg 2. The rules are the standard ones: only move one disk at a time, can't place a larger disk on a smaller one. And they insist on the full list without truncation.

First, I remember that the minimum number of moves for n disks is 2^n - 1. For 7 disks, that's 127 moves. So the solution should have exactly 127 moves. The challenge is to generate each move correctly in order.

Looking at the search results, the iterative solution mentioned in source [4] alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Since 7 is odd, the direction might be different. Wait, the note in source [2] says that for even disks, the movement is reversed. Since 7 is odd, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move in a left direction initially? Or maybe the direction depends on the parity. The iterative solution from [4] says to alternate moves between the smallest and non-smallest. The direction for the smallest is to the right if the number of disks is even, left if odd. So for 7 disks (odd), the smallest moves to the left each time.

But how does that translate into peg movements? The pegs are 0, 1, 2. Moving left from peg 0 would go to peg 2 (since it's a circular arrangement?), or maybe peg 1? Wait, the example in [4] mentions moving the smallest piece to the opposite end if there's no position in the chosen direction. So for odd disks, the smallest moves left, which would be from peg 0 to peg 2, then peg 2 to peg 1, then peg 1 to peg 0, etc. Wait, maybe the direction is cyclic. Let me think.

The iterative approach steps are:

1. Move the smallest disk in the prescribed direction (left for odd n).
2. Make the only valid move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

Repeating these steps until all disks are moved.

So for each step, first move disk 1 left (peg 0 → peg 2, then peg 2 → peg 1, then peg 1 → peg 0, etc.), then make the only possible move between the other two pegs that's valid.

But how to model this algorithmically? Let's outline the steps for 3 disks first to see the pattern. The example given in the query for 3 disks has the moves:

[[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2]]

Which totals 7 moves, as expected. Let's see the pattern here. The first move is disk 1 from 0 to 2. Then disk 2 from 0 to 1. Then disk 1 from 2 to 1. Then disk 3 from 0 to 2. Then disk 1 from 1 to 0. Then disk 2 from 1 to 2. Then disk 1 from 0 to 2. So the smallest disk moves every other move, alternating with moving the next available disk.

For 7 disks, the pattern would be similar but longer. Each time, the smallest disk moves left (since 7 is odd), and the other moves are determined by the available pegs.

Alternatively, using the recursive approach: To move n disks from source to target, you move n-1 disks to the auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the target, then move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to target. But the recursive approach would generate the moves in a certain order. However, for 7 disks, the recursive method would produce the correct sequence but might be harder to enumerate without a program.

But the user wants the iterative solution's moves. Let's refer to the sources. Source [2] mentions a step-by-step for 7 disks, but the description is a bit unclear. It talks about moving disk 1 left, then disk 2, etc., following a pattern. The key is that for each "cycle", you move the smallest disk in a circular manner (left or right depending on parity), then the next available disk.

Given that the minimum moves are 127, the list must have exactly 127 entries. Let's try to generate the sequence step by step.

Starting with all disks on peg 0: [7,6,5,4,3,2,1]

The goal is to move them all to peg 2.

Since 7 is odd, the smallest disk (1) moves left (from peg 0 to peg 2, then peg 2 to peg 1, then peg 1 to peg 0, etc.) in each alternate move.

The algorithm would be:

- For each move:
   - If it's an odd-numbered move (1st, 3rd, etc.), move disk 1 to the next peg in the left direction (since n is odd).
   - If it's an even-numbered move, make the only possible move that doesn't involve disk 1.

But how to determine the direction for disk 1? For odd n, the direction is left, which for pegs 0,1,2 would mean moving to (current -1) mod 3. Wait, but 0-1 mod 3 is 2. So moving left from peg 0 would be to peg 2, then from peg 2 to peg 1, then from peg 1 to peg 0, etc.

So the sequence for disk 1 would be: 0→2, 2→1, 1→0, 0→2, etc.

The even moves involve moving the next possible disk. For example, after moving disk 1 to peg 2, the next move is to move the smallest possible disk that's not 1, which would be disk 2, but only if it's legal. Wait, no. The even moves are the non-smallest disk moves. The only legal move between the two pegs that don't have disk 1. For example, after moving disk 1 to peg 2, the other pegs are 0 and 1. The top disks there are 2 on peg 0 and nothing on peg 1. So the move would be disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.

Then move disk 1 again to the left (from peg 2 to peg 1), but wait, that's not allowed because peg 1 now has disk 2. So disk 1 can't go there. Wait, no. Disk 1 is smaller than disk 2, so it can be placed on top. So after disk 2 is on peg 1, moving disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1 is allowed.

Wait, let's step through the initial moves for 3 disks to see the pattern:

Move 1: disk 1 from 0→2 (smallest move left)
Move 2: disk 2 from 0→1 (only possible non-1 move)
Move 3: disk 1 from 2→1 (smallest move left again)
Move 4: disk 3 from 0→2 (non-1 move)
Move 5: disk 1 from 1→0 (smallest move left)
Move 6: disk 2 from 1→2 (non-1 move)
Move 7: disk 1 from 0→2 (smallest move left)

Which matches the example given. So for each even move, we move the next available disk between the two pegs not containing disk 1. The direction for the non-1 moves depends on which peg has the smaller disk.

So applying this to 7 disks, the iterative approach would require alternating between moving disk 1 left and making the only possible non-1 move.

To generate all 127 moves, we can simulate this process.

Let's outline the steps:

Initialize pegs as [[7,6,5,4,3,2,1], [], []]
moves = []

direction for disk 1: left (since n=7 is odd), so each move of disk 1 is to the previous peg (0→2, 2→1, 1→0, etc.)

For each move number from 1 to 127:
   if move is odd:
      move disk 1 to the next peg in the left direction
   else:
      determine the two pegs that don't have disk 1
      find the smaller top disk between those two pegs
      move it to the other peg

But how to track the state of the pegs? Since manually simulating 127 steps is error-prone, perhaps there's a pattern or a way to generate the moves algorithmically.

Alternatively, using the recursive approach, the moves can be generated by the standard Tower of Hanoi recursive algorithm, which for n disks from A to C using B as auxiliary:

If n == 1:
   move disk 1 from A to C
Else:
   move n-1 disks from A to B using C
   move disk n from A to C
   move n-1 disks from B to C using A

This recursive approach would generate the moves in the order that matches the minimum number of steps. However, the order of moves might differ from the iterative approach, but both are valid as long as they follow the rules.

But the user's example uses the iterative approach's move order. For 3 disks, the example moves are:

1: 1,0,2
2: 2,0,1
3: 1,2,1
4: 3,0,2
5: 1,1,0
6: 2,1,2
7: 1,0,2

Which corresponds to the recursive solution's steps. Wait, no. The recursive solution for 3 disks would be:

Move 1-3: move disks 1 and 2 from A to B using C:
   1: 1 A→C
   2: 2 A→B
   3: 1 C→B
Then move disk 3 A→C
Then move disks 1 and 2 from B to C using A:
   4: 1 B→A
   5: 2 B→C
   6: 1 A→C

But the example's moves are different. The example's moves are:

1:1→2 (A→C)
2:2→1 (A→B)
3:1→1 (C→B)
4:3→2 (A→C)
5:1→0 (B→A)
6:2→2 (B→C)
7:1→2 (A→C)

So the order is different. The recursive approach groups the moves into larger chunks, while the iterative approach interleaves the moves of smaller disks.

But both approaches are valid. However, the user's example uses the iterative approach's move order. Therefore, to match the expected format, perhaps the iterative approach is required.

But generating the exact move sequence for 7 disks manually is impractical. However, sources [2] and [4] provide some guidance. Source [2] mentions for 7 disks, following the algorithm where you move disk 1 left, then the next disk, etc., repeating the pattern.

Given that the solution must be the optimal 127 moves, and the example uses the iterative method, I'll proceed to generate the moves using the iterative approach.

The steps for the iterative solution are as follows:

1. Determine the direction for the smallest disk (left for odd n).
2. Alternate between moving the smallest disk and making the only possible non-smallest move.

For 7 disks, the smallest disk (1) moves left each time. The direction for left is: 0→2, 2→1, 1→0, etc.

The non-smallest moves are determined by the two pegs not containing the smallest disk. The top disks of those two pegs are compared, and the smaller one is moved on top of the larger one.

To generate the moves programmatically, one would simulate each step:

- Track the current peg of each disk.
- For each move:
   - If odd move number, move disk 1 left.
   - If even move number, find the two pegs not containing disk 1, compare their top disks, and move the smaller one onto the larger one.

But since I can't run code here, I need to find a pattern or a way to list all 127 moves correctly.

Alternatively, I can recall that the standard iterative solution's moves can be determined based on the binary representation of the move numbers, but that might be more complex.

Another approach is to note that each disk moves in a pattern. For example, disk 1 moves every other move, disk 2 moves every 4th move, disk 3 every 8th, etc. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, using the recursive approach, the sequence can be generated by the following steps:

For n=7, moving from peg 0 to peg 2 with peg 1 as auxiliary.

The recursive steps would be:

1. Move disks 1-6 from 0 to 1 using 2.
2. Move disk 7 from 0 to 2.
3. Move disks 1-6 from 1 to 2 using 0.

Each of these steps would involve recursive moves. However, listing all these moves manually is error-prone, but perhaps there's a pattern.

However, the user's example for 3 disks uses the iterative approach, so perhaps the expected answer follows the iterative method.

Given the complexity, perhaps the best way is to rely on the sources provided. Source [2] provides a step-by-step for 7 disks, but the exact moves aren't listed. However, the description mentions moving disk 1 left, then disk 2, etc., following a repeating pattern.

Alternatively, source [4] mentions the iterative solution's steps, which for odd n involves moving the smallest disk in a left direction and making the only possible non-smallest move.

Given that, here's how the moves would proceed for 7 disks:

Move 1: Disk 1 from 0→2 (left direction)
Move 2: The only possible non-1 move is between pegs 0 and 1. The top disks are 2 on peg 0 and nothing on peg 1. So move disk 2 from 0→1.
Move 3: Disk 1 from 2→1 (left direction)
Move 4: Now, non-1 move between pegs 0 and 2. Peg 0 has disk 3, peg 2 has nothing. Move disk 3 from 0→2.
Move 5: Disk 1 from 1→0 (left direction)
Move 6: Non-1 move between pegs 1 and 2. Peg 1 has disk 2, peg 2 has disk 3. Move disk 2 from 1→2 (since 2 < 3).
Move 7: Disk 1 from 0→2 (left direction)
Move 8: Non-1 move between pegs 0 and 1. Peg 0 has disk 4, peg 1 has nothing. Move disk 4 from 0→1.
Move 9: Disk 1 from 2→1 (left direction)
Move 10: Non-1 move between pegs 2 and 0. Peg 2 has disks 3,2,1 (wait, no, after move 7, peg 2 has disk 3 and disk 1? Wait, let's track the state.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to track the first few moves:

Initial state:
Peg 0: [7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
Peg 1: []
Peg 2: []

Move 1: Disk 1 from 0→2
Peg 0: [7,6,5,4,3,2]
Peg 1: []
Peg 2: [1]

Move 2: Move non-1 disk. The pegs without disk 1 are 0 and 1. Peg 0 has 2 on top, peg 1 is empty. So move disk 2 from 0→1.
Peg 0: [7,6,5,4,3]
Peg 1: [2]
Peg 2: [1]

Move 3: Disk 1 from 2→1 (left direction from 2 is 1)
Peg 0: [7,6,5,4,3]
Peg 1: [2,1]
Peg 2: []

Move 4: Non-1 move between pegs 0 and 2. Peg 0 has 3, peg 2 is empty. Move disk 3 from 0→2.
Peg 0: [7,6,5,4]
Peg 1: [2,1]
Peg 2: [3]

Move 5: Disk 1 from 1→0 (left direction from 1 is 0)
Peg 0: [7,6,5,4,1]
Peg 1: [2]
Peg 2: [3]

Move 6: Non-1 move between pegs 1 and 2. Peg 1 has 2, peg 2 has 3. Move disk 2 from 1→2 (since 2 < 3)
Peg 0: [7,6,5,4,1]
Peg 1: []
Peg 2: [3,2]

Move 7: Disk 1 from 0→2 (left direction from 0 is 2)
Peg 0: [7,6,5,4]
Peg 1: []
Peg 2: [3,2,1]

Move 8: Non-1 move between pegs 0 and 1. Peg 0 has 4, peg 1 is empty. Move disk 4 from 0→1.
Peg 0: [7,6,5]
Peg 1: [4]
Peg 2: [3,2,1]

Move 9: Disk 1 from 2→1 (left direction from 2 is 1)
Peg 0: [7,6,5]
Peg 1: [4,1]
Peg 2: [3,2]

Move 10: Non-1 move between pegs 2 and 0. Peg 2 has 3,2; peg 0 has 5. Move the smaller top disk between 3 and 5. Since 3 <5, move disk 3 from 2→0.
Peg 0: [7,6,5,3]
Peg 1: [4,1]
Peg 2: [2]

Move 11: Disk 1 from 1→0 (left direction from 1 is 0)
Peg 0: [7,6,5,3,1]
Peg 1: [4]
Peg 2: [2]

Move 12: Non-1 move between pegs 1 and 2. Peg 1 has 4, peg 2 has 2. Move disk 2 from 2→1 (since 2 <4)
Peg 0: [7,6,5,3,1]
Peg 1: [4,2]
Peg 2: []

Move 13: Disk 1 from 0→2 (left direction from 0 is 2)
Peg 0: [7,6,5,3]
Peg 1: [4,2]
Peg 2: [1]

Move 14: Non-1 move between pegs 0 and 1. Peg 0 has 3, peg 1 has 4,2. Move disk 3 from 0→1 (since 3 <4)
Peg 0: [7,6,5]
Peg 1: [4,2,3]
Peg 2: [1]

Move 15: Disk 1 from 2→1 (left direction from 2 is 1)
Peg 0: [7,6,5]
Peg 1: [4,2,3,1]
Peg 2: []

Move 16: Non-1 move between pegs 0 and 2. Peg 0 has 5, peg 2 is empty. Move disk 5 from 0→2.
Peg 0: [7,6]
Peg 1: [4,2,3,1]
Peg 2: [5]

... and this continues until all disks are on peg 2.

Each time, the smallest disk moves left, and the non-1 move is determined by the available pegs. This process would generate all 127 moves. However, manually listing each move is impractical here. But since the user insists on the complete list, I need to find a way to generate it.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula to determine each move's disk, from, and to pegs based on the move number. For example, in the iterative solution, the moves can be determined by the binary representation of the move number, but I'm not certain.

Another approach is to recognize that the standard solution for Tower of Hanoi can be represented as a sequence where each move corresponds to the Gray code sequence, where each step changes only one bit, corresponding to moving the smallest disk. But I'm not sure how to apply that here.

Given the time constraints and the requirement to provide the complete list, I'll have to rely on the fact that the optimal solution for 7 disks requires 127 moves, and the iterative approach's pattern as described. However, generating all 127 moves manually is error-prone. 

But perhaps the sources provide a pattern. Source [2] mentions that for 7 disks, after each algorithm run, you repeat the process. The algorithm involves moving disk 1 left, then disk 2, etc. The exact sequence would follow the iterative steps as outlined earlier.

Given that, the correct move list would be the standard iterative solution for 7 disks, which follows the pattern of moving the smallest disk left (0→2→1→0...) and making the only possible non-1 move each time.

Therefore, the final answer is the list of 127 moves generated by this iterative process. Since I can't simulate all 127 steps here, I must provide the correct sequence. However, I recall that the standard solution for Tower of Hanoi can be generated algorithmically, and the correct move list for 7 disks is well-known, though lengthy.

After careful consideration and following the iterative approach described in the sources, the complete list of moves is as follows:
