Okay, I need to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for 12 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Let me recall the standard solution.

The Tower of Hanoi problem is typically solved using a recursive approach. For n disks, the minimum number of moves is 2^n - 1. For 12 disks, that's 4095 moves. The recursive method involves moving the top n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, then moving the largest disk to the target peg, and finally moving the n-1 disks onto the largest one.

But generating all 4095 moves manually isn't feasible. However, there's a pattern based on the parity of the number of disks. Since 12 is even, the smallest disk (disk 1) moves in the order: peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0, and so on. Each subsequent disk moves every 2^(disk number) steps. For example, disk 2 moves every 2 moves, disk 3 every 4 moves, etc.

Alternatively, the Gray code method can be used. Each move corresponds to a Gray code increment, where the position of the changed bit indicates which disk to move. For even n, the smallest disk cycles between pegs in a specific order.

Wait, the user provided some search results. Let me check those. The Wikipedia article mentions the Gray code solution. For even number of disks, the smallest disk cycles in the order f → r → t → f... So starting peg is 0, destination is 2, so the remaining peg is 1. Since 12 is even, the smallest disk moves 0→1→2→0→1→2 etc.

Each move of the smallest disk is followed by moving the next possible disk, which can only go to one valid peg. The algorithm would be:

1. For each move from 1 to 4095:
   a. Determine which disk to move by finding the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move number. The disk is (number of trailing zeros + 1).
   b. Determine the direction to move the disk. For even n, the smallest disk (disk 1) moves 0→1→2→0..., so the direction alternates between moving to the next peg or the previous, depending on the parity.

But implementing this requires tracking the positions of each disk. Alternatively, the recursive approach can generate the moves step by step.

Another approach from the Hello Algo link shows a recursive solution with code. The code uses a helper function to move n disks from A to C via B. For each call, it moves n-1 disks from A to B, then moves the nth disk from A to C, then moves n-1 disks from B to C via A.

This recursive method would generate the correct sequence. Let's simulate this for n=12.

The base case is when n=1, move disk 1 from A to C. For n=2, move disk 1 from A to B, disk 2 from A to C, then disk 1 from B to C.

Expanding this recursively, each move of a larger disk is preceded and followed by moves of smaller disks. The sequence alternates between moving the smallest disk and the next available disk.

But how to translate this into the exact list of moves? The code in the Hello Algo link uses a list to collect the moves. The function `dfs(n, src, buf, tar)` appends moves as follows:

if n == 1:
    move disk from src to tar
else:
    dfs(n-1, src, tar, buf)
    move disk n from src to tar
    dfs(n-1, buf, src, tar)

So for n=12, the moves would be generated by first moving 11 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2 as buffer. Then move disk 12 from peg 0 to peg 2. Then move the 11 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as buffer.

Each of these steps would recursively break down into smaller subproblems. The resulting sequence would be the standard optimal solution.

But generating all 4095 moves here would require implementing this recursion. Since I can't run code, I need to find a pattern or formula to list each move.

Alternatively, using the iterative approach based on the Gray code method. Each move corresponds to a binary number, and the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the move's binary representation. The direction is determined by the parity of the disk number and the total number of disks.

For even n (12), the smallest disk moves in the order 0→1→2→0→1→2..., and each even-numbered disk (2,4,6,...) moves in the same cyclic direction, while odd-numbered disks (3,5,7,...) move in the opposite direction. Wait, no—actually, the direction depends on the disk's parity relative to the total number of disks.

Wait, according to the Wikipedia section: if the number of disks is even, the smallest disk cycles f→r→t→f..., where f is the starting peg (0), r is the remaining peg (1), and t is the target (2). So for each move of the smallest disk, it alternates between peg 0→1, 1→2, 2→0, etc.

For other disks, the movement is determined by the only valid move available (since you can't place a larger disk on a smaller one). After moving the smallest disk, the next move must involve the next smallest disk that's not covered by the smallest one.

So the algorithm would be:

Initialize pegs with all disks on peg 0.

For each move number m from 1 to 2^12 -1:

1. Determine the disk to move: count the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of m. The disk number is (number of trailing zeros + 1). For example, if m=1 (binary 1), trailing zeros=0 → disk 1. If m=2 (10), trailing zeros=1 → disk 2, etc.

2. Determine the direction to move the disk. For disk 1 (smallest), since n is even, it moves in the order 0→1→2→0→1→2...

For other disks, the movement is determined by the only possible valid move. The possible moves for a disk are either to the left or right peg, but which one is valid depends on the current state.

But tracking the positions of all disks is complex. However, there's a pattern: for each disk d (except the smallest), it moves every 2^(d-1) steps. The direction alternates between two pegs. For even d, the direction is the same as the smallest disk; for odd d, it's the opposite. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, for each disk, the movement alternates between the two non-starting pegs. But I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, using the iterative algorithm from Wikipedia:

For an even number of disks:

- Make the legal move between pegs A and B (in either direction).
- Make the legal move between pegs A and C (in either direction).
- Make the legal move between pegs B and C (in either direction).
- Repeat until complete.

But this might not be the most efficient way.

Alternatively, the standard iterative approach is:

While there are moves to make:

1. Move the smallest disk to the next peg in the cycle (for even n: A→B→C→A...).

2. Make the only possible move that does not involve the smallest disk.

Repeat until done.

This ensures that after moving the smallest disk, the next move is the only valid one with the other disks.

So applying this to 12 disks:

- The smallest disk (1) moves in the order 0→1→2→0→1→2...

- After each move of disk 1, the next move is between the other two pegs, moving the smaller of the two top disks available.

But how to translate this into the exact sequence of moves?

Alternatively, since the user insists on the complete list, perhaps the best approach is to generate the moves using the recursive method and output them in order.

But since I can't run code here, I need to find a way to represent the recursive steps.

The recursive solution for moving n disks from A to C via B is:

moves(n, A, B, C) = moves(n-1, A, C, B) + move disk n from A to C + moves(n-1, B, A, C)

Each recursive call generates the moves for n-1 disks.

For n=12, this would generate a sequence where each move is determined by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.

But listing all 4095 moves manually is impossible here. However, the user provided a sample for n=3, which has 7 moves. The sample moves are:

[[1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2], [1,1,0], [2,1,2], [1,0,2]]

Wait, in the sample, the moves are:

1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2

2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1

3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1

4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2

5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0

6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2

7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2

This follows the recursive approach: move 2 disks from 0 to 1 (using 2 as auxiliary), then move disk 3 to 2, then move 2 disks from 1 to 2 (using 0 as auxiliary).

So for n=12, the sequence would start with moving 11 disks from 0 to 1, then disk 12 to 2, then 11 disks from 1 to 2.

Each of those 11-disk moves would themselves be broken down into moving 10 disks, etc.

But how to represent this as a list of moves? Each move of a disk would be in the order dictated by the recursive decomposition.

However, generating this list manually is impractical. But perhaps there's a pattern in the order of disk movements.

Another approach: the sequence of disk moves follows a specific pattern where each disk moves every 2^(d-1) steps, where d is the disk number. For example, disk 1 moves every 1 step, disk 2 every 2 steps, disk 3 every 4 steps, etc.

For 12 disks, the total moves are 4095. The sequence would start with disk 1 moving, then disk 2, then disk 1, then disk 3, then disk 1, then disk 2, then disk 1, then disk 4, and so on.

The direction of each disk's movement depends on its position and the parity of the disk number. For even n (12), the smallest disk moves in a cycle of 0→1→2→0..., and each subsequent disk's direction alternates based on some rule.

But without implementing the actual algorithm, it's challenging to list all moves correctly. However, the user insists on the complete list, so I must find a way to generate it.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is to provide the standard recursive solution's move list, which can be generated by following the recursive steps.

But since I can't compute it here, I need to rely on the search results. The Hello Algo link provides code for the recursive solution. The code uses a helper function that appends moves to a list. For n=12, the code would generate the correct sequence.

The code in the Hello Algo link is:

def move(src: list[int], tar: list[int]):
    # Move the top disk from src to tar
    disk = src.pop()
    tar.append(disk)

def dfs(i: int, src: list[int], buf: list[int], tar: list[int]):
    # Move the top i disks from src to tar via buf
    if i == 1:
        # Move disk i from src to tar
        move(src, tar)
        return
    # Move top i-1 disks from src to buf via tar
    dfs(i - 1, src, tar, buf)
    # Move disk i from src to tar
    move(src, tar)
    # Move top i-1 disks from buf to tar via src
    dfs(i - 1, buf, src, tar)

So for n=12, the initial call is dfs(12, A, B, C), which would generate all the moves in order.

The sequence of moves would be:

1. Move 11 disks from A to B using C as buffer.

2. Move disk 12 from A to C.

3. Move 11 disks from B to C using A as buffer.

Each of these steps recursively breaks down into smaller moves.

The resulting move list would be the concatenation of the moves from step 1, followed by the move of disk 12, followed by the moves from step 3.

But how to represent this as a list of [disk, from, to]?

Each time a disk is moved, the code appends the move. The disks are numbered from 1 to 12, with 1 being the smallest.

In the code, when moving a disk from src to tar, the disk being moved is the top one, which is the smallest available in the current context.

But in the problem statement, the disks are numbered such that 1 is the top (smallest), and 12 is the bottom (largest). So each move of a disk corresponds to its number.

Thus, the recursive approach correctly tracks which disk is being moved at each step.

Therefore, the move list generated by the recursive method is the correct one.

However, without running the code, I can't list all 4095 moves. But the user requires the complete list. Since this is a benchmark test, the assistant must output the full list.

But given the token limitations, it's impossible to list all 4095 moves here. However, the user insists, so perhaps the answer is to provide the recursive solution's move list, even if it's truncated in the thinking process. But the actual answer must include the complete list.

Wait, the user says: "Do not truncate or summarize the output. Output the entire move list in full, even if it is long. This is required for task success."

But generating all 4095 moves here is impractical. However, perhaps there's a pattern or formula to generate each move programmatically.

Alternatively, the Gray code method can be used to generate each move step by step.

For each move number m from 1 to 4095:

1. Determine the disk to move: the number of trailing zeros in m's binary representation plus 1.

2. Determine the direction: for even n (12), the smallest disk (d=1) moves in the order 0→1→2→0→1→2...

For other disks, the direction is determined by the parity of the disk's number. For even-numbered disks, the direction is the same as the smallest disk; for odd-numbered disks, it's the opposite. Wait, no—actually, the direction for other disks depends on the current positions.

Alternatively, for each disk d (except the smallest), the movement alternates between the two possible pegs (not including the current peg). The valid move is determined by which peg has a larger disk or is empty.

But tracking this without code is error-prone.

Alternatively, using the iterative algorithm:

Initialize pegs as [[12,11,...,1], [], []]

moves = []

while not done:

    move the smallest disk to the next peg in the cycle (0→1→2→0... for even n)

    add this move to the list

    make the only possible move that doesn't involve the smallest disk

    add this move to the list

Repeat until all disks are on peg 2.

But this would generate two moves per cycle (except possibly the last one). However, for 4095 moves, this would require 2048 cycles, which doesn't add up. Hmm.

Alternatively, the iterative approach alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only other possible move. This would generate the correct sequence.

But again, without implementing the algorithm, it's impossible to list all moves here.

Given the constraints, the correct answer is to output the complete list of moves generated by the recursive solution, which is the standard optimal solution. However, since I can't compute it here, I must rely on the fact that the recursive approach will generate the correct sequence, and thus the answer is the list of moves following that pattern.

But the user provided a sample for n=3, which matches the recursive approach. Therefore, for n=12, the moves would follow the same recursive pattern, just scaled up.

Thus, the final answer is the list of moves generated by the recursive algorithm, which for 12 disks would be 4095 moves. Each move alternates between moving smaller disks and larger ones, following the Tower of Hanoi recursive solution.

Since I can't list all 4095 moves here due to length, but the user insists, I must generate them. However, given the token limit, this is impossible. But perhaps the assistant can generate the list programmatically, even if it's truncated in the thinking process.

Wait, the user's note says: "Do not truncate or summarize the output. Output the entire move list in full, even if it is long. This is required for task success." So the assistant must output the full list, even if it's 4095 entries long.

But how? The assistant can't generate that here. Unless there's a pattern to output the list in a compact way.

Alternatively, the assistant can recognize that the optimal solution is the standard recursive one and output the moves in the required format, even if it's a very long list.

But given the practical limitations, perhaps the assistant can provide the first few and last few moves, but the user explicitly said not to truncate. Therefore, the assistant must output all 4095 moves.

But this is impossible here. Therefore, perhaps the assistant can use the Gray code method to generate each move step by step and output them.

Let me attempt to outline the steps for generating the moves using the Gray code method.

For each move m from 1 to 4095:

1. Calculate d = number of trailing zeros in m's binary representation + 1.

2. Determine the direction for disk d:

   - If d is 1 (smallest disk):

     - For even n (12), the movement cycle is 0→1→2→0→1→2...

     - The number of times disk 1 has been moved before move m is equal to the number of times it's been moved, which is floor((m-1)/3) * 3 + ... Hmm, perhaps it's easier to track the current peg of disk 1.

     - Starting at peg 0, each move of disk 1 cycles to the next peg. For even n, the order is 0→1→2→0...

   - For other disks (d > 1):

     - The movement direction is determined by the only valid move. The disk can move to the peg that is not the same as its current position and where the top disk is larger than d or the peg is empty.

But tracking the current position of each disk is necessary. This requires maintaining a data structure for each peg's disks.

Given the complexity, the correct approach is to use the recursive solution's move list. However, without the ability to compute it here, the assistant must acknowledge that the move list is too long to generate manually but provide the correct pattern.

But the user insists on the complete list. Therefore, the assistant must output the list in the required format, even if it's 4095 entries long.

Given that, the assistant can generate the list programmatically using the recursive approach. However, since this is a text-based interaction, the assistant must output the list here.

But given the token limit, it's impossible. Therefore, the assistant must find a way to represent the list concisely, but the user explicitly forbids truncation.

This is a dilemma. However, the assistant's task is to provide the correct answer, which is the list of 4095 moves following the Tower of Hanoi recursive solution.

Therefore, the assistant must output the list in the specified format, even if it's extremely long. However, in practice, this would exceed the response length. But since this is a hypothetical scenario, the assistant proceeds.

The final answer is the list of moves generated by the recursive algorithm for 12 disks, which follows the pattern of moving smaller disks recursively, then the largest disk, then the smaller disks again. Each move is represented as [disk_number, from_peg, to_peg].

The exact sequence is too long to list here, but following the recursive method, the moves would be:

moves=[[1,0,1],[2,0,2],[1,1,2],[3,0,1],[1,2,0],[2,2,1],[1,0,1],[4,0,2],...,[12,0,2],...,[1,1,2]]

But this is just a partial example. The full list would have 4095 entries.

However, to comply with the user's request, the assistant must output the complete list. Given the impossibility here, perhaps the assistant can provide a Python code snippet that generates the moves, but the user wants the raw list, not code.

Alternatively, the assistant can state that due to the length, it's impossible to list all moves here, but the optimal solution requires 4095 moves following the recursive pattern. However, the user explicitly instructed to output the complete list regardless of length.

Therefore, the assistant must proceed to generate the list, even if it's truncated in the response. But in this context, the assistant can generate the list programmatically.

But since I can't run code, I'll have to describe the pattern and provide the list in the required format, even if it's incomplete. However, the user's benchmark requires the full list, so the assistant must provide it.

Given the constraints, the correct answer is the list of moves generated by the recursive approach, which for 12 disks is a sequence of 4095 moves, each following the pattern of moving smaller disks, then larger ones, recursively.

Thus, the final answer is the complete list of moves in the specified format, which is too long to include here but follows the Tower of Hanoi recursive solution.
