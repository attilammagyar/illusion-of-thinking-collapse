Okay, so I need to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 12 disks. The goal is to move all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Let me recall how Tower of Hanoi works. The standard solution involves recursion: move n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the target peg, and then move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary to the target. Each move must follow the rules of not placing a larger disk on a smaller one.

The minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1. For 12 disks, that's 2^12 - 1 = 4095 moves. So the list should have 4095 entries. The user wants the complete list without any truncation, just the CSV format with disk_id, from_peg, to_peg.

But generating all 4095 moves manually is impossible. However, there's an iterative approach mentioned in the search results. The iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only valid move with a non-smallest disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Since 12 is even, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move cyclically: peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0, etc.

Each step alternates between moving the smallest disk and the only possible legal move with another disk. The iterative approach can be programmed, but I need to simulate it step by step.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Initialize the pegs: peg0 has disks 12 to 1, peg1 and peg2 are empty.
2. Determine the direction for the smallest disk. Since 12 is even, the smallest moves right (0→1→2→0...).
3. For each move:
   a. If it's an odd move number, move the smallest disk in the current direction.
   b. If even, make the only legal move possible that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

But how to track the state of each peg? Maybe using arrays to represent each peg's disks. However, manually generating 4095 steps is impractical. Instead, I can use the recursive approach to generate the sequence.

Wait, the recursive method for Tower of Hanoi can be represented as follows:

To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:
- Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using target.
- Move disk n from source to target.
- Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target using source.

Each of these steps can be broken down recursively. For 12 disks, this would generate the correct sequence. But how to translate this into the specific moves?

Alternatively, the iterative algorithm steps can be followed. Let's refer to the search result [2], which mentions the iterative solution. For even n, the smallest disk moves in a cycle (right), and the non-smallest moves are determined by the only legal move.

But implementing this requires keeping track of the positions of each disk and the allowed moves. Since the user insists on the complete list, I need to generate each move step by step.

Alternatively, there's a pattern in the moves. For example, the sequence of moves for 3 disks is known, and for each additional disk, the number of moves doubles plus one. But generating the exact sequence for 12 disks would require knowing the order of disk movements.

Another approach is to note that each disk moves in a pattern. The smallest disk moves every other move. The number of times each disk moves is 2^(12 - k) times for disk k. But how to determine the from and to pegs each time?

Alternatively, the iterative approach can be codified as follows:

- While there are moves to make:
   - Move the smallest disk to the next peg in the direction (right for even n).
   - Make the only possible move with the remaining disks.

But simulating this step-by-step for 12 disks would take a long time. However, since the user requires the complete list, perhaps there's a pattern or formula to generate each move's from and to pegs.

Alternatively, the binary representation of the move numbers can determine the disk to move. Each move corresponds to a bit in binary, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the search result [2] mentions that the iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and a non-smallest. For even n, the smallest moves right (0→1→2→0...). Each non-smallest move is the only legal one available.

So, for 12 disks (even), the smallest disk (1) moves right each time. The non-smallest moves are determined by the two pegs that don't have the smallest disk, and the only legal move between them.

This can be automated. Let's try to outline the steps:

Initialize pegs:
peg0 = [12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
peg1 = []
peg2 = []

direction for smallest disk: right (0→1→2→0...)

moves = []

for each move from 1 to 4095:
   if move is odd:
      move disk 1 to next peg in direction
   else:
      find the two pegs that don't have disk 1
      check which of the two possible moves is legal (smaller disk on top)
      make that move

But how to track the state of each peg? Since manually simulating 4095 steps is impossible, perhaps there's a pattern in the moves.

Alternatively, the recursive approach can generate the sequence. For example, moving 12 disks from peg0 to peg2 using peg1 as auxiliary.

The recursive steps would be:

1. Move disks 1-11 from peg0 to peg1 using peg2.
2. Move disk 12 from peg0 to peg2.
3. Move disks 1-11 from peg1 to peg2 using peg0.

Each of these steps is recursive. The moves for step 1 would involve moving 11 disks, which in turn requires moving 10 disks, etc.

But how to translate this into the actual list of moves? Each recursive call would generate a sequence of moves. For example, moving 1 disk is trivial. Moving 2 disks requires moving the top disk to the auxiliary, then the bottom disk to target, then the top disk back.

But for 12 disks, this would generate a very long sequence. However, the pattern is deterministic. Each disk's movement follows a specific pattern based on its position.

Alternatively, the sequence can be generated using the binary representation of the move numbers. Each move corresponds to a binary digit, and the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation. For move number m (starting from 1), the disk to move is the number of trailing zeros in m's binary plus 1.

For example, move 1 (binary 1) has 0 trailing zeros → disk 1.
Move 2 (10) has 1 trailing zero → disk 2.
Move 3 (11) → 0 trailing zeros → disk 1.
Move 4 (100) → 2 trailing zeros → disk 3.
And so on.

Once the disk is determined, the direction of movement depends on whether the disk is even or odd. For even-numbered disks, the direction is one way; for odd, another. But since the total number of disks is even (12), the direction might be different.

Wait, according to the iterative solution in [2], for an even number of disks, the smallest moves to the right, and the non-smallest moves are determined. But the direction for other disks might depend on their position.

Alternatively, the from and to pegs can be determined based on the disk's number and the current positions.

But this is getting complicated. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to generate the sequence programmatically, but since I can't write code here, I need to find a pattern or formula.

Alternatively, refer to the recursive solution and note that each disk's moves alternate between pegs. For example, disk 1 moves every other move, alternating between pegs. Disk 2 moves every 4 moves, disk 3 every 8 moves, etc.

But how to determine the from and to pegs for each disk's move?

Another approach: The Tower of Hanoi problem can be represented as a state transition where each state is the configuration of the pegs. However, enumerating all states is impractical.

Alternatively, use the fact that the sequence of moves for n disks is the same as for n-1 disks, with additional moves for the nth disk. But again, without a program, it's hard to list all moves.

Wait, the user provided an example for 3 disks. Let's see the pattern there:

The example moves are:
1,0,2
2,0,1
1,2,1
3,0,2
1,1,0
2,1,2
1,0,2

This follows the recursive approach:
- Move disks 1-2 from 0 to 1 (using 2 as auxiliary).
- Move disk 3 from 0 to 2.
- Move disks 1-2 from 1 to 2 (using 0 as auxiliary).

The moves for 3 disks are 7, which is 2^3 -1.

For 12 disks, the sequence would be similar but much longer. Each move of a larger disk is surrounded by moves of smaller disks.

But generating this manually is impossible. However, the user insists on the complete list. Since the assistant can't generate 4095 moves here due to token limits, but the problem states that the assistant must output the complete list even if it risks truncation, perhaps the correct approach is to provide the list up to the token limit, but the user might have a way to handle it.

Wait, the user says: "Do not truncate or summarize the moves. Output the entire move list in full, even if it is long. This is required for task success."

But given the context, perhaps the assistant is expected to provide the correct CSV list, even if it's truncated in the response. However, the assistant must try to output as much as possible.

Alternatively, the assistant can generate the list programmatically, but within the text. However, without actual code execution, it's impossible.

Wait, the search result [2] mentions the iterative solution steps. For even n, the smallest disk moves right, and the non-smallest moves are determined by the only legal move.

So, for 12 disks, the iterative approach would be:

- Initialize pegs.
- Smallest disk (1) moves right each odd move.
- Even moves: make the only legal move between the two pegs not involving the smallest disk.

This can be simulated step by step. Let's try to outline the first few moves:

Move 1 (odd): move disk 1 from 0→1.
Move 2 (even): move the only possible non-1 disk, which is disk 2 from 0→2 (since 0 has disk 2, and 2 is empty).
Move 3 (odd): move disk 1 from 1→2.
Move 4 (even): move disk 3 from 0→1.
Move 5 (odd): move disk 1 from 2→0.
Move 6 (even): move disk 2 from 2→1 (since disk 1 is on 0, and disk 2 can go on disk 3 which is on 1).
Move 7 (odd): move disk 1 from 0→1.
Move 8 (even): move disk 4 from 0→2.
... and so on.

This pattern continues, with each even move involving the next available disk that can be moved between the two non-1 pegs.

But simulating this for 4095 steps is impractical manually. However, the assistant is expected to provide the complete list. Since this is impossible here, perhaps the correct answer is to acknowledge that the list is too long but provide the initial and final moves, but the user explicitly insists on the full list.

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can generate the list using a formula. Each move can be determined by its number.

Another approach is to note that the sequence of moves for Tower of Hanoi can be represented using a Gray code sequence, where each move corresponds to a single bit change. However, connecting this to the actual disk moves is non-trivial.

Alternatively, the assistant can refer to the recursive solution and generate the moves accordingly. For example, the recursive function for moving n disks from source to target using auxiliary would generate the moves as follows:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"1,{source},{target}")
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        print(f"{n},{source},{target}")
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

For n=12, this would generate the correct sequence. However, the order of the moves would be such that smaller disks are moved first, following the recursive steps.

But again, without executing the code, the assistant can't list all 4095 moves. However, the user might expect the assistant to provide the correct CSV output as per the recursive solution.

Given that the user insists on the complete list and the assistant's limitations, perhaps the assistant should proceed to output the CSV list as per the recursive solution, even if it's truncated in the response. However, the assistant must ensure that the list is correct up to the point it can generate.

But wait, the example given for 3 disks uses the recursive approach. The moves are:

1,0,2
2,0,1
1,2,1
3,0,2
1,1,0
2,1,2
1,0,2

Which matches the recursive steps:

- Move 1-2 from 0 to 1 (using 2 as auxiliary):
  - Move 1 from 0 to 2 (auxiliary)
  - Move 2 from 0 to 1 (target)
  - Move 1 from 2 to 1 (auxiliary to target)
- Move 3 from 0 to 2
- Move 1-2 from 1 to 2 (using 0 as auxiliary):
  - Move 1 from 1 to 0
  - Move 2 from 1 to 2
  - Move 1 from 0 to 2

Thus, for 12 disks, the recursive approach would generate the correct sequence. Each time a larger disk is moved, it's preceded and followed by the moves of the smaller disks.

Therefore, the correct CSV list is the one generated by the recursive algorithm, which for 12 disks would have 4095 moves. However, generating this manually is impossible. But perhaps the assistant can output the list in the required format, acknowledging that it's the optimal solution generated recursively.

But since the assistant can't actually compute it here, perhaps the answer should state that the solution requires 4095 moves following the recursive pattern and provide the initial and final moves as examples, but the user insists on the complete list.

Given the constraints, the assistant must provide the complete list. However, due to token limitations, it's impossible to list all 4095 moves here. But the user's note says to output the complete list even if it risks truncation. Therefore, the assistant should proceed to generate the list programmatically within the answer, even if it's truncated.

But how? The assistant can't run code. Alternatively, the assistant can describe the method to generate the list and then provide a sample of the moves, but the user explicitly wants the complete list.

This is a dilemma. The correct answer is the list of 4095 moves generated by the recursive or iterative method. Since the assistant can't generate it here, perhaps the answer should acknowledge that and provide a link to a script or the method, but the user wants the raw list.

Alternatively, the assistant can generate the list using the iterative approach steps, but again, without actual computation, it's impossible.

Wait, the search result [2] mentions that the minimum number of moves is 2^12 -1 = 4095, which matches the formula. The example for 3 disks uses 7 moves. The assistant must output all 4095 moves in CSV format.

Given that, perhaps the assistant can provide the list in the answer, but due to length, it's truncated. However, the user's note says to output it regardless. Therefore, the assistant must proceed to write out the entire list, even if it's extremely long.

But practically, this is impossible within the context of this platform. However, the assistant can start generating the list following the recursive pattern, showing the first few moves and the pattern, but the user insists on the complete list.

Given the instructions, the assistant must comply. Therefore, the answer will be the CSV list of all 4095 moves, generated programmatically. However, since the assistant can't execute code, it must rely on the standard solution pattern.

The correct answer is the sequence generated by the recursive algorithm, which for 12 disks moving from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1 as auxiliary. Each move follows the recursive steps, and the CSV list is built accordingly.

Thus, the assistant will output the complete list of moves in CSV format, starting with disk 1 moving from 0 to 1, then disk 2 from 0 to 2, and so on, following the recursive pattern. However, due to the sheer length, the list will be extremely long, but the assistant must generate it as per the instructions.
