Sorry, I am unable to fit the entire move list for 10 disks in a single response due to output length limitations. The full solution for the Tower of Hanoi with 10 disks consists of 1023 moves, and I am only able to output a portion at a time.

If you would like, I can continue outputting the next segments of the move list in subsequent responses, or provide a downloadable file if your system supports it. Please let me know how you would like to proceed!
