Certainly! This is the classic **Tower of Hanoi** problem for \( n = 14 \) disks.

### **Solution Approach**

The recursive solution for Tower of Hanoi is:

1. Move \( n-1 \) disks from source peg to auxiliary peg.
2. Move the largest disk (\( n \)) from source peg to target peg.
3. Move \( n-1 \) disks from auxiliary peg to target peg.

Each move is recorded as \([disk\_id, from\_peg, to\_peg]\), where disk\_id is the disk number (1 is smallest, 14 is largest).

### **Python Code to Generate the Moves**

Below is the code to generate the full list of moves for \( n = 14 \):

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(14, 0, 2, 1, moves)
print(moves)
```

---

### **Number of Moves**

The minimum number of moves required is:  
\[
2^{14} - 1 = 16383
\]

---

### **First 10 Moves (for illustration)**

Here are the first 10 moves (the full list is 16,383 moves):

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    ...
]
```

### **Full List of Moves**

The full sequence is very large (16,383 moves). If you want the **entire list** in a downloadable file or as a text block, please specify your preferred format.

#### **Summary**

- **Algorithm:** Recursive Tower of Hanoi
- **Moves List Format:** `[disk id, from peg, to peg]`
