Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 8 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's 8 disks, which is an even number, I remember that the iterative solution might involve moving the smallest disk in a specific pattern. 

First, the minimum number of moves required is 2^8 - 1, which is 255. That's a lot of moves to list out, but the user insists on the full list. The challenge is to generate each move correctly without making any mistakes.

From the search results, the iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move in a consistent direction, maybe to the right. Each time, after moving the smallest, there's only one legal move for the next non-smallest disk.

Looking at the example for 3 disks, the moves start with moving disk 1 from 0 to 2. Then disk 2 from 0 to 1, and so on. The pattern seems to follow a specific sequence where the smallest disk alternates between pegs, and the other moves are determined by what's legal.

I need to make sure each move adheres to the rules: no larger disk on top of a smaller one. Each move must specify the disk number, source peg, and destination peg. Since the disks are numbered 1 (smallest) to 8 (largest), each move will involve these numbers.

Let me start building the sequence step by step. The first move is disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1. Wait, no—wait, for even disks, the initial direction might be different. Wait, in the example with 3 disks (odd), the first move was to peg 2. For even, maybe the first move is to peg 1. Let me check the search result [4], which mentions that for an even number of disks, the stack ends up on peg C (which is peg 2 here). Wait, no—the iterative solution section in [4] says that if the number of disks is even, the stack ends up on peg C. But the solution steps mention alternating moves between pegs. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at the iterative solution steps in [4], the sequence is:

1. Move one disk from peg A to peg B or vice versa, whichever is legal.
2. Move one disk from peg A to peg C or vice versa, whichever is legal.
3. Move one disk from peg B to peg C or vice versa, whichever is legal.

But I'm not sure how that applies here. Maybe another approach is to use the recursive method. For 8 disks, the recursive solution would involve moving the top 7 disks to peg 1, then moving disk 8 to peg 2, then moving the 7 disks from peg 1 to peg 2. But generating the exact sequence for 8 disks recursively would require breaking it down into smaller steps, which might be complex.

Alternatively, the iterative approach might be more straightforward to implement programmatically. The key is to alternate moving the smallest disk and the next possible disk. For even n, the smallest disk moves in a specific direction each time. Let's see: for each move, if it's an even-numbered step, move the smallest disk, else move the next available disk.

Wait, the iterative solution from [4] says that for an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Let me check the "Simpler statement of iterative solution" in [4]. It mentions that for even n, the stack ends up on peg C. The steps involve alternating between moving the smallest and the next possible disk.

Alternatively, looking at the example in [5], the solution for 3 disks starts with moving disk 1 to the right. But maybe for 8 disks, the direction alternates. The iterative solution from [4] says to alternate moves between the smallest and non-smallest, with the direction depending on the parity of the number of disks.

Given that 8 is even, the smallest disk (1) should move in a specific direction each time. Let's say the order is peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0, etc. So the first move is disk 1 from 0 to 1. Then the next move is the smallest possible non-1 disk, which would be disk 2, but wait, after moving disk 1, the next move must be the only legal move that doesn't involve disk 1. So after moving disk 1 to peg 1, the next move is disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2. Then disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2. Then disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1. Then disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0. Disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1. Disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1. Disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2. And so on.

This pattern follows the standard Tower of Hanoi iterative solution. Each time, the smallest disk moves in a cycle (0→1→2→0 for even n), and the other moves are determined by the only legal move available that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

To generate all 255 moves, I need to follow this pattern meticulously. Each step alternates between moving the smallest disk and the next possible disk. However, manually listing all 255 moves is error-prone. Instead, I can model this algorithmically.

The algorithm for the iterative solution is as follows:

1. Initialize three pegs (0, 1, 2).
2. For the smallest disk (1), determine the direction based on the parity of the number of disks. For even n, move clockwise (0→1→2→0...); for odd n, counter-clockwise (0→2→1→0...). Since we have 8 disks (even), the direction is clockwise.
3. Alternate between moving the smallest disk and making the only legal move possible with the remaining disks.

Implementing this step-by-step:

- Move 1: Disk 1 from 0 to 1 (smallest disk moves clockwise)
- Move 2: Move the next possible disk (disk 2) from 0 to 2 (only legal move not involving disk 1)
- Move 3: Disk 1 from 1 to 2
- Move 4: Disk 3 from 0 to 1
- Move 5: Disk 1 from 2 to 0
- Move 6: Disk 2 from 2 to 1
- Move 7: Disk 1 from 0 to 1
- Move 8: Disk 4 from 0 to 2
- ... and so on until all disks are on peg 2.

Each time, after moving the smallest disk, the next move is determined by the only legal move available between the non-smallest disks. This process continues until all disks are moved.

Given the complexity, the correct sequence must be generated algorithmically. However, since I can't execute code here, I need to rely on the known optimal solution for 8 disks. According to search result [3], the number of moves is 255, which matches 2^8 -1.

The user provided an example for 3 disks, which has 7 moves. The example moves are:

[[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2]]

This follows the pattern of moving the smallest disk alternately, then the next available disk. For 8 disks, the pattern continues similarly but with more steps.

To ensure correctness, I can reference the structure from the example and scale it up. Each time a larger disk is moved, it's placed on an empty peg or on top of a larger disk. The recursive approach would involve breaking the problem into moving n-1 disks, then the nth disk, then n-1 again. However, the iterative approach is more straightforward for generating the move list.

Given the constraints, the correct move list for 8 disks must be generated following the iterative method, ensuring each move adheres to the rules. Since manually listing 255 moves is impractical, the answer must be generated programmatically, but since I can't run code, I need to provide the correct sequence based on known algorithms.

After careful consideration, the optimal move list for 8 disks is a sequence of 255 moves following the iterative approach, moving the smallest disk clockwise each time and making the only legal move for the non-smallest disks. The exact list can be generated using a standard Tower of Hanoi algorithm, ensuring each move is valid.
