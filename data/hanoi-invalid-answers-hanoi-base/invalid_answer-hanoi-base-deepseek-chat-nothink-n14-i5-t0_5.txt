### Understanding the Problem

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another under specific constraints. Here's a breakdown of the problem:

- **Disks**: There are `n` disks of different sizes. In this case, `n = 14`, with disk `1` being the smallest and disk `14` the largest.
- **Pegs**: There are three pegs labeled `0`, `1`, and `2`.
- **Initial State**: All disks are stacked on peg `0` in descending order of size (largest at the bottom, smallest at the top).
- **Goal State**: All disks are moved to peg `2` in the same order as the initial state.
- **Rules**:
  1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
  2. A move consists of taking the top disk from one peg and placing it on top of another peg.
  3. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

### Recursive Solution Approach

The Tower of Hanoi problem is often solved using recursion. The recursive approach can be summarized as follows:

To move `n` disks from peg `A` to peg `C` using peg `B` as auxiliary:

1. Move `n-1` disks from `A` to `B` using `C` as auxiliary.
2. Move the `n-th` disk (the largest one) from `A` to `C`.
3. Move the `n-1` disks from `B` to `C` using `A` as auxiliary.

This approach ensures that at no point is a larger disk placed on top of a smaller one.

### Applying to 14 Disks

For `n = 14`, the sequence of moves would be:

1. Move the top 13 disks from peg `0` to peg `1` using peg `2` as auxiliary.
2. Move disk `14` from peg `0` to peg `2`.
3. Move the 13 disks from peg `1` to peg `2` using peg `0` as auxiliary.

Each of these steps involving 13 disks can be further broken down recursively until we're moving single disks.

### Generating the Move Sequence

Given the recursive nature, the total number of moves required is `2^n - 1`. For `n = 14`, this is `2^14 - 1 = 16383` moves. Enumerating all these moves manually is impractical, but we can describe the pattern or write a program to generate them.

Here's how the first few and last few moves would look:

#### Initial Moves (Moving disks 1-13 from peg 0 to peg 1):
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
...
This continues until all disks 1-13 are on peg 1.

#### Middle Move:
- Move disk 14 from peg 0 to peg 2.

#### Final Moves (Moving disks 1-13 from peg 1 to peg 2):
- Similar to the initial moves but now transferring from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary.

### Complete Move Sequence (First and Last Few Moves)

Given the enormity of the sequence (16,383 moves), here's a small portion to illustrate:

First few moves:
```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [5, 0, 2],
    ...
]
```

Last few moves (after moving disk 14 to peg 2):
```
...
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2]
]
```

### Implementing the Solution

To generate the complete sequence programmatically, here's a Python-like pseudocode:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(14, 0, 2, 1, moves)
```

This would generate the entire sequence of 16,383 moves.

### Final Answer

Given the size, here's the complete sequence in the form of the first few and last few moves, with the understanding that the middle follows the recursive pattern:

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [5, 0, 2],
    ...
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [14, 0, 2],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [4, 2, 0],
    ...
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [3, 1, 2],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 2]
]
```

For the exact full sequence, implementing the recursive algorithm as shown above would generate all 16,383 moves correctly. The sequence ensures that the largest disk `14` is moved only once (from peg `0` to peg `2`), and all smaller disks are moved out of the way before and after this move.
