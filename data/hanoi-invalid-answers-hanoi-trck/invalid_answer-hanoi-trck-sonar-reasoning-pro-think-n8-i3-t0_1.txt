Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 8 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation, just the raw data in the specified format. Hmm, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi has a recursive solution. For n disks, the minimum number of moves is 2^n - 1. So for 8 disks, that's 255 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

First, I need to recall the standard recursive approach. The steps are: move n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg, move the nth disk from source to target, then move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to target. But writing out all 255 moves manually would be tedious. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula to generate each move.

Looking at the search results, result [3] from Wikipedia mentions a binary solution. It says that each move can be determined by the binary representation of the move number. The formulas for from_peg and to_peg are given using bitwise operations. For odd n, the formulas are (m & m - 1) % 3 for from_peg and ((m | m - 1) + 1) % 3 for to_peg. But since we have 8 disks (even n), the references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed. Wait, the note in [3] says for even n puzzles, the output references to pegs 1 and 2 should be reversed. So maybe the formulas need adjustment for even n.

Alternatively, there's another formulation using (m - (m & -m)) % 3 for from_peg and (m + (m & -m)) % 3 for to_peg. But again, for even n, we might need to swap pegs 1 and 2. Let me think. The standard Tower of Hanoi solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. The smallest disk moves in a cyclic manner. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in the opposite direction compared to odd. So for 8 disks (even), the direction might be different.

Wait, the user's goal is to move all disks from peg 0 to peg 2. The standard solution for even n might require adjusting the peg order. Let me check the example given in the query. The example with 3 disks starts at peg 0 and moves to peg 2. The solution provided in the example seems to follow a certain pattern. But how does that translate to 8 disks?

Another approach from the search results is the iterative method. Each move can be determined by the binary representation of the move number. The disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move count. For each move m (starting from 1), the number of trailing zeros in m-1 gives the disk to move. Then, the direction depends on whether the disk is even or odd.

Wait, the Wikipedia entry [3] mentions that the disk to move is determined by the number of times m can be divided by 2 (i.e., the number of trailing zeros in m's binary representation) plus 1. So for move m, the disk is (number of trailing zeros in m) + 1. For example, move 1 (binary 1) has 0 trailing zeros, so disk 1. Move 2 (10) has 1 trailing zero, disk 2. Move 3 (11) has 0, disk 1. Move 4 (100) has 2 trailing zeros, disk 3, etc.

Then, the direction for each disk depends on whether the disk number is even or odd. For even n, the smallest disk (disk 1) moves in a different direction. For 8 disks (even), the direction alternates. So disk 1 (smallest) moves in a cycle: 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 1, etc. Each subsequent disk moves in the opposite direction of the smallest disk's movement.

But how to translate this into the from_peg and to_peg for each move? Let's try to outline the steps.

For each move m from 1 to 255:

1. Determine the disk to move: k = number of trailing zeros in (m) + 1. Wait, no, the formula in [3] says the number of trailing zeros in m (the move count) gives the number of times m can be divided by 2. Wait, the example says for move 216 (which is 2^3 * 27), the number of trailing zeros is 3, so disk 3 + 1 = 4. Wait, maybe the formula is (number of trailing zeros in (m)) + 1. So for m=1 (binary 1), trailing zeros=0, disk 1. m=2 (10), trailing zeros=1, disk 2. m=3 (11), trailing zeros=0, disk 1. m=4 (100), trailing zeros=2, disk 3. m=5 (101), trailing zeros=0, disk 1. m=6 (110), trailing zeros=1, disk 2. m=7 (111), trailing zeros=0, disk 1. m=8 (1000), trailing zeros=3, disk 4. That seems to fit.

2. Once the disk is determined, determine the direction. For even-numbered disks, the direction is different. Wait, no, the direction depends on the parity of the disk number. For disk 1 (smallest), if the total number of disks is even, it moves in a different cycle. For example, in the standard Tower of Hanoi, if the number of disks is even, the smallest disk moves clockwise (0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0), and if odd, counter-clockwise (0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0). But in this problem, the target is peg 2, so maybe the direction is adjusted.

Alternatively, using the formulas from [3], which involve bitwise operations. Let's try to apply the formulas for each move m.

From [3], for odd n (number of disks), the from_peg and to_peg are calculated as:

from_peg = (m & m - 1) % 3

to_peg = ((m | m - 1) + 1) % 3

But for even n, we need to swap pegs 1 and 2 in the output. So after calculating from_peg and to_peg using the formulas, if n is even, swap 1 and 2 in the results.

Wait, the note in [3] says: "For even n puzzles, the output references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed." So after computing from_peg and to_peg using the formulas, if the result is 1, change it to 2, and if it's 2, change it to 1. But peg 0 remains the same.

Alternatively, maybe the formulas are adjusted for even n. Let me check the exact wording: "For even n puzzles, the output references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed." So the formulas are for odd n, and for even n, after applying the formulas, swap 1 and 2 in the from_peg and to_peg.

So for each move m:

1. Compute from_peg_initial = (m & (m - 1)) % 3

2. Compute to_peg_initial = ((m | (m - 1)) + 1) % 3

3. If n is even (which it is, 8 is even), then swap 1 and 2 in from_peg and to_peg.

For example, if from_peg_initial is 1, set it to 2; if it's 2, set to 1. Same for to_peg_initial.

But wait, the example in the query has 3 disks (n=3, odd), and the solution moves are:

1,0,2,...

So for m=1, from_peg_initial would be (1 & 0) %3 = 0, to_peg_initial = ((1 | 0)+1)%3 = (1+1)%3=2. So 0->2, which matches the example. For n=3 (odd), no swapping needed.

But for n=8 (even), after computing from_peg_initial and to_peg_initial, we need to swap 1 and 2.

So let's test this with m=1 for n=8:

from_peg_initial = (1 & 0) %3 = 0

to_peg_initial = ((1 | 0)+1)%3 = 2

Since n is even, swap 1 and 2 in the result. But the result is 0 and 2. Swapping 1 and 2 doesn't affect 0 and 2. So from_peg remains 0, to_peg remains 2. So move 1: 0->2.

Which is correct for the first move of the Tower of Hanoi with even disks. The smallest disk moves from 0 to 2.

Wait, but in some solutions, for even n, the smallest disk moves 0->1->2->0..., but according to this formula, the first move is 0->2. Hmm, maybe the direction is different. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe the standard solution for even n is to alternate the direction of the smallest disk. Let's think: for n=1 (odd), move 0->2. For n=2 (even), the moves are 0->1, 0->2, 1->2. So the smallest disk (1) moves 0->1->2. So for even n, the smallest disk moves in a different cycle. But according to the formula, with swapping, maybe the direction is adjusted.

But according to the formula, for n=8 (even), after computing from_peg and to_peg using the odd formula, we swap 1 and 2. Let's take m=1:

from_peg = 0, to_peg = 2. No swap needed since they are 0 and 2. So move 1: 0->2.

For m=2:

from_peg_initial = (2 & 1) %3 = 0, to_peg_initial = ((2 |1)+1)%3 = (3+1)%3=1. Then swap 1 and 2: to_peg becomes 2. So move 2: 0->1? Wait, no. Wait, the initial to_peg_initial is 1, which after swapping becomes 2. So from_peg remains 0, to_peg becomes 2. Wait, that can't be right. Because for move 2 in n=2, the move is 0->1.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the swapping. Let's re-express the note from [3]: "For even n puzzles, the output references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed." So whenever the formula outputs 1, it becomes 2, and vice versa. So for the from_peg and to_peg, after applying the formula, swap 1 and 2.

So for m=2 in n=8:

Compute from_peg_initial = (2 & 1) %3 = 2 &1 is 0, 0%3=0.

to_peg_initial = ((2 |1)+1)%3 = (3+1)%3=1%3=1.

Now, since n is even, swap 1 and 2 in both from_peg and to_peg. But from_peg is 0, so remains 0. to_peg_initial is 1, which becomes 2. So move 2: 0->2. But that's not correct for n=2. Wait, for n=2, the moves are:

1. Move 1 from 0->1

2. Move 2 from 0->2

3. Move 1 from 1->2

But according to the formula, for m=1 (n=2 even):

from_peg_initial = (1 &0)%3=0, to_peg_initial= ((1|0)+1)%3=2. Swap 1 and 2: to_peg becomes 2 (no change). So move 1: 0->2. But that's incorrect for n=2. The first move should be 0->1.

Hmm, this suggests that the formula might not be directly applicable for even n, or perhaps I'm misapplying it. Maybe the formulas in [3] are for moving to peg 1, and when the target is peg 2, adjustments are needed. Alternatively, perhaps the swapping is not just for the output, but the entire algorithm is adjusted.

Alternatively, maybe the binary solution works differently. Let's think about the binary representation of the move numbers. For each move, the binary representation indicates the direction. For even n, the parity of the disk number affects the direction.

Another approach from [5] mentions algorithms for solving the Tower of Hanoi, focusing on the top three disks. It describes moving Disk 1 left, then Disk 2, etc. But with 8 disks, this would be complex.

Alternatively, the recursive approach: to move 8 disks from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as auxiliary. The steps would be:

1. Move 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary.

2. Move disk 8 from peg 0 to peg 2.

3. Move 7 disks from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary.

But generating all 255 moves recursively would require tracking each step, which is not feasible manually. Hence, the need for an algorithmic approach.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best way is to implement the binary solution with the peg swapping for even n. Let's proceed step by step for the first few moves to see if the pattern holds.

For n=8 (even), each move m from 1 to 255:

1. Determine the disk to move: count the number of trailing zeros in m (binary representation), add 1.

2. Determine the direction for that disk. For even-numbered disks, the direction is different. Wait, no, the direction depends on the disk's parity. For disk 1 (smallest), if n is even, it moves in a cycle 0->2->1->0... For each subsequent disk, the direction alternates.

But perhaps using the formulas from [3] with swapping pegs 1 and 2 for even n is the way to go.

Let's test m=1 to m=3:

m=1:

trailing zeros in 1 (binary 1) is 0. Disk = 0 +1 =1.

Using the formula for from_peg and to_peg:

from_peg = (1 & 0) %3 =0.

to_peg = ((1 |0)+1)%3 = (1+1)%3=2.

Since n is even, swap 1 and 2 in the result. But from_peg is 0, to_peg is 2. No swapping needed. So move 1: 0->2. Disk 1 moves to peg 2.

m=2:

trailing zeros in 2 (binary 10) is 1. Disk=1+1=2.

from_peg = (2 &1) %3=0.

to_peg = ((2|1)+1)%3= (3+1)%3=1.

Swap 1 and 2: to_peg becomes 2. So move 2: 0->2. Wait, but disk 2 can't move on top of disk 1 (which is on peg 2). This suggests an error. Wait, no. After move 1, peg 2 has disk 1. Now, move 2 is moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1 (original to_peg 1, but after swapping, to_peg 2). Wait, no. Wait, the formulas give to_peg_initial as 1, which after swapping becomes 2. So move 2 is from peg 0 to peg 2. But disk 2 is larger than disk 1, which is already on peg 2. That's invalid. So this can't be right.

Hmm, this indicates a problem with the approach. Maybe the swapping is applied differently. Alternatively, perhaps the formulas are for a different target peg. Let's reconsider.

The standard Tower of Hanoi problem moves disks from peg 0 to peg 2. For even n, the smallest disk moves in a different direction. Let's see:

For n=2 (even):

Move 1: disk 1 from 0->1

Move 2: disk 2 from 0->2

Move 3: disk 1 from 1->2

But according to the formula with swapping:

For m=1:

from_peg =0, to_peg=2 (after swapping, since n is even, to_peg becomes 2? Wait, no. Wait, the note says for even n, swap references to pegs 1 and 2. So in the formulas, if the result is 1, change to 2, and vice versa. So for m=1, to_peg_initial is 2 (from the formula for odd n), but since n is even, we don't swap because the result is 2. Wait, no. The note says "output references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed." So any occurrence of 1 becomes 2, and 2 becomes 1. So for m=1, to_peg_initial is 2, which remains 2. So move 1: 0->2. But that's incorrect for n=2. The first move should be 0->1.

This suggests that the formula might not be directly applicable when the target peg is different. Maybe the formulas in [3] assume the target is peg 1 for even n. Alternatively, perhaps the formulas need adjustment based on the target peg.

Alternatively, perhaps the direction for the smallest disk is determined by the parity of the number of disks. For even n, the smallest disk moves clockwise (0->1->2->0), and for odd n, counter-clockwise (0->2->1->0). So for n=8 (even), the smallest disk moves 0->1->2->0...

But in the user's problem, the target is peg 2. So the standard solution would require the smallest disk to cycle through pegs in a certain order to facilitate the moves.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to generate the moves using the recursive method, but since that's 255 moves, it's impractical to do manually. However, the user insists on the complete list, so I need to find a way to generate it programmatically.

Alternatively, using the iterative approach described in the binary solution, adjusting for even n by swapping the direction of the smallest disk's movement.

Another idea: the sequence of moves for the Tower of Hanoi can be generated by the Gray code sequence, where each consecutive move differs by one bit, corresponding to moving the smallest disk. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, refer to the example given in the query for 3 disks. The solution there has 7 moves. Let's see if the formulas apply.

For 3 disks (n=3, odd):

m=1:

from_peg = (1 &0)%3=0

to_peg = ((1|0)+1)%3=2

No swapping needed. Move 0->2. Correct.

m=2:

from_peg = (2 &1)%3=0

to_peg = ((2|1)+1)%3= (3+1)%3=1

Move 0->1. Correct.

m=3:

from_peg = (3 &2)%3= 2%3=2

to_peg = ((3|2)+1)%3= (3+1)%3=1

Move 2->1. But in the example, move 3 is from peg 2 to peg 1. Which matches. So the formula works for odd n.

But for even n, after swapping, the to_peg and from_peg would be adjusted.

So, applying this to n=8 (even), for each move m:

1. Calculate from_peg and to_peg using the formulas for odd n.

2. Swap any occurrence of 1 and 2 in the from_peg and to_peg.

For example, if the formula gives from_peg=1, change it to 2, and vice versa.

Let's test this for m=1 (n=8):

from_peg = (1 &0)%3=0

to_peg = ((1|0)+1)%3=2

Since n is even, swap 1 and 2 in the result. But 0 and 2 are not 1 or 2, so no change. Move 0->2. Correct.

m=2:

from_peg = (2 &1)%3=0

to_peg = ((2|1)+1)%3= (3+1)%3=1

Swap 1 and 2: to_peg becomes 2. So move 0->2. But disk 2 can't go on top of disk 1. Wait, this suggests a problem. Wait, after move 1, peg 2 has disk 1. Move 2 is moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2, but disk 2 is larger than disk 1. That's invalid. So something's wrong.

Ah, here's the issue. The formula might not be directly applicable when swapping pegs 1 and 2. Alternatively, perhaps the target peg is different. Maybe the formulas are designed for moving to peg 1, and when moving to peg 2, adjustments are needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the swapping is applied differently. Let's reconsider the note in [3]: "For even n puzzles, the output references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed." This might mean that in the entire solution, whenever a move involves peg 1 or 2, they are swapped. So the actual pegs used are 0, 2, 1 instead of 0, 1, 2.

Wait, that could be. For even n, the auxiliary peg is peg 1, but swapping pegs 1 and 2 in the solution would mean that the moves are adjusted accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard solution for even n uses peg 1 as the auxiliary, but the user's target is peg 2, so the swapping is necessary.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe the best approach is to use the recursive method and generate the moves step by step, keeping track of the peg states.

But generating 255 moves manually is impossible. Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to use the binary solution formulas, adjusting for even n by swapping pegs 1 and 2 in the from and to pegs.

Let's proceed with that approach and generate the moves.

For each move m from 1 to 255:

1. Calculate k = number of trailing zeros in m (binary representation) + 1. This gives the disk to move.

2. Calculate from_peg and to_peg using the formulas for odd n, then swap 1 and 2 if n is even.

But wait, the formulas in [3] are:

from_peg = (m & m - 1) % 3

to_peg = ((m | m - 1) + 1) % 3

For even n, swap 1 and 2 in the output.

Let's implement this for m=1 to m=255.

But how to compute this for each m?

Alternatively, use the other formulation:

from_peg = (m - (m & -m)) % 3

to_peg = (m + (m & -m)) % 3

Again, for even n, swap 1 and 2.

Let's test this for m=1:

m=1:

m & -m = 1 & -1 (in two's complement, which is all bits set for -1 in binary, but in 32-bit it's 0xFFFFFFFF. However, in JavaScript, it's 32-bit signed. But perhaps in this context, it's bitwise AND of m and its two's complement negative.

For m=1 (binary 0001), -m is 1111 in 4-bit, so m & -m = 0001 & 1111 = 0001 =1.

from_peg = (1 -1) %3 =0%3=0

to_peg = (1 +1)%3=2%3=2

Since n is even, swap 1 and 2. But from_peg is 0, to_peg is 2. No swap needed. Move 0->2. Correct.

m=2:

m=2 (binary 0010), -m=1110 (in 4-bit two's complement), m&-m=0010 & 1110=0010=2.

from_peg = (2-2)%3=0

to_peg = (2+2)%3=4%3=1

Swap 1 and 2: to_peg becomes 2. So move 0->2. But disk 2 can't be placed on disk 1. Wait, this suggests an error. But according to the Tower of Hanoi rules, after move 1 (disk 1 to peg 2), move 2 should move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1. But according to this formula, it's moving to peg 2, which is invalid. So something's wrong.

Ah, here's the mistake. For even n, the formulas are adjusted by swapping pegs 1 and 2. But in the initial setup, the target is peg 2. The standard solution for even n might require using peg 1 as the intermediate, leading to different moves.

This indicates that the formulas from [3] might not be directly applicable when the target peg is 2 for even n. Perhaps the formulas assume the target is peg 1 for even n, hence the need to swap.

To resolve this, perhaps the correct approach is to generate the moves as if the target is peg 1 for even n, then swap the pegs 1 and 2 in the final output.

Wait, that could work. For example, if the standard solution for even n moves disks to peg 1, but the user wants them on peg 2, then swapping all references to peg 1 and 2 in the move list would adjust the solution accordingly.

So the plan is:

1. Generate the move sequence as if the target is peg 1 (for even n=8).

2. Swap all occurrences of peg 1 and 2 in the from_peg and to_peg fields.

This way, the moves that would have gone to peg 1 now go to peg 2, and vice versa.

But how to generate the moves for target peg 1? Using the formulas without swapping.

Wait, the note in [3] says that for even n, the references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed. So if the standard solution for odd n uses pegs 0,1,2 with target peg 2, then for even n, the solution would target peg 1, hence requiring swapping.

But the user's target is peg 2. So to adjust, we need to swap pegs 1 and 2 in the move list generated for even n.

Therefore, the correct approach is:

- Treat n=8 as even, generate the moves using the formulas for odd n (which target peg 1), then swap pegs 1 and 2 in the from_peg and to_peg fields.

This way, the target becomes peg 2 instead of 1.

Let's test this with m=2:

Original formulas (for odd n, target peg 1):

from_peg = (2 &1)%3=0

to_peg = ((2|1)+1)%3=1

After swapping 1 and 2, to_peg becomes 2. So move 2: 0->2. But this is invalid because peg 2 has disk 1. Wait, no. After move 1, peg 2 has disk 1. Move 2 is moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2. But disk 2 is larger than disk 1, which violates the rule. So this can't be right.

Hmm, this suggests that swapping pegs 1 and 2 in the entire move list isn't the correct approach. There must be a different way to adjust the formulas for even n when the target is peg 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the direction of the smallest disk's movement is different. For even n, the smallest disk moves 0->1->2->0..., while for odd n, it's 0->2->1->0...

If that's the case, then for even n=8, the smallest disk (1) moves in the cycle 0->1->2->0...

Each time the smallest disk moves, it's to the next peg in the cycle. Then, the larger disks follow a different pattern.

But how to determine the moves for all disks based on this.

Alternatively, the iterative algorithm for Tower of Hanoi is as follows:

For each move m from 1 to 2^n -1:

1. Determine the disk to move by finding the number of trailing zeros in m's binary representation plus 1.

2. Move the disk in the direction based on its parity:

   - If the disk number is odd, move it in the direction opposite to the smallest disk.

   - If the disk number is even, move it in the same direction as the smallest disk.

But the direction of the smallest disk depends on the total number of disks. For even n, smallest moves 0->1->2->0...

For each disk k:

- If k is odd, move it in the opposite direction of the smallest disk.

- If k is even, move it in the same direction.

But I'm not sure about this. Let's see for n=2:

Moves:

1. Move 1 from 0->1

2. Move 2 from 0->2

3. Move 1 from 1->2

For disk 1 (odd), direction is 0->1->2->0... (same as smallest disk's direction for even n). Wait, but disk 1 is odd, and n=2 is even. According to the rule, odd disks move opposite to the smallest disk. But in this case, disk 1 is the smallest and moves in the same direction. This suggests the rule might be different.

Alternatively, the direction for each disk is determined by whether the disk number is even or odd. For even n:

- Even-numbered disks move in the same direction as the smallest disk.

- Odd-numbered disks move in the opposite direction.

But this is getting too vague. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best way is to proceed with the binary solution formulas, adjusting for even n by swapping pegs 1 and 2 in the from and to pegs, and generate the move list accordingly, even if it results in some initial errors, and then correct them as per the example's error correction method.

The user mentioned that the output can include corrections by repeating move_ids with corrected values. So even if some initial moves are incorrect, subsequent corrections can fix them.

But given the complexity, perhaps the correct approach is to use the recursive solution and generate the moves step by step. However, implementing that manually for 255 moves is impractical.

Alternatively, use the fact that the Tower of Hanoi solution follows a specific pattern where each odd-numbered move involves the smallest disk, and even-numbered moves involve the next disk.

But without a clear algorithm, it's challenging. Given the search results, the binary solution from [3] seems the most promising, despite the initial hiccups.

Let's proceed with the binary solution, applying the formulas and swapping pegs 1 and 2 for even n.

For each move m from 1 to 255:

1. Calculate from_peg and to_peg using the formulas for odd n:

   from_peg = (m & (m - 1)) % 3

   to_peg = ((m | (m - 1)) + 1) % 3

2. Swap pegs 1 and 2 in the from_peg and to_peg.

3. Record the move.

But let's test this for the first few moves:

m=1:

from_peg = (1 & 0) %3 =0

to_peg = ((1 |0)+1)%3=2

swap 1 and 2: no change. Move 0->2. Disk 1 moves to peg 2.

m=2:

from_peg = (2 &1) %3=0

to_peg = ((2|1)+1)%3= (3+1)%3=1

swap 1 and 2: to_peg becomes 2. Move 0->2. But disk 2 can't go on peg 2 (has disk 1). Invalid.

This indicates a problem. So the formula isn't working as expected for even n.

Alternative approach: Maybe the formulas are correct, but the initial assumption about the target peg is wrong. If the target peg for even n is peg 1, then swapping pegs 1 and 2 in the move list would adjust it to the user's target peg 2.

So generate the moves as if the target is peg 1 (using the formulas without swapping), then swap all 1 and 2 in the from_peg and to_peg.

For example:

Original move (for target peg 1):

m=1: 0->2

m=2: 0->1

m=3: 2->1

...

After swapping 1 and 2:

m=1: 0->1

m=2: 0->2

m=3: 1->2

Which matches the n=2 solution.

So this seems correct. Therefore, the correct approach is:

1. Generate the moves using the formulas for odd n (target peg 2).

2. For even n, swap all occurrences of peg 1 and 2 in the from_peg and to_peg.

This effectively changes the target from peg 1 to peg 2.

Let's test this:

For n=8 (even), generate moves as if target is peg 1 (using formulas for odd n), then swap 1 and 2.

For m=1:

from_peg =0, to_peg=2 (as per odd n formula). Swap 1 and 2: to_peg becomes 1. So move 0->1. But this is the first move for n=2, which is correct.

Wait, but the user's target is peg 2. By swapping 1 and 2, the moves that would have gone to peg 1 now go to peg 2, and vice versa. So the initial target peg 1 becomes peg 2.

Yes, this makes sense. So the process is:

- Use the formulas to generate moves for odd n (target peg 2).

- For even n, swap pegs 1 and 2 in the move list to change the target to peg 2.

Thus, the correct move list for even n is obtained by taking the move list for odd n and swapping pegs 1 and 2.

Let's verify this with n=2:

Original moves for odd n=2 (target peg 2):

But wait, n=2 is even. Wait, this approach might require generating the moves for odd n, then swapping.

Alternatively, perhaps the formulas for odd n generate moves to peg 2, and for even n, swapping pegs 1 and 2 redirects the moves to peg 2.

This is getting too convoluted. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with generating the moves using the formulas from [3], applying the swap for even n, and output the move list. If there are errors, they can be corrected in subsequent move_ids as per the user's example.

Thus, the final answer will be a CSV-style list of moves generated using the binary solution formulas, swapping pegs 1 and 2 for even n, and ensuring that each move is valid. Given the complexity, some moves might need correction, but the user's example allows for error correction by redefining move_ids.
