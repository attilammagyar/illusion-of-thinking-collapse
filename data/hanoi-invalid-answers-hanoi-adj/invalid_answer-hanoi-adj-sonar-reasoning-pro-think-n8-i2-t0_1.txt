Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 8 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's 8 disks, which is an even number, I remember that the iterative solution might involve moving the smallest disk in a specific direction each time. 

First, the minimum number of moves required should be 2^8 - 1, which is 255 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list. The challenge is generating all 255 moves correctly without missing any steps.

Looking at the search results, the iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern, maybe to the right each time. Each move of a non-smallest disk is determined by the only legal move available.

I need to simulate this process step by step. Let's start with the initial state: all disks on peg 0. The smallest disk (1) is on top. The first move should be moving disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1. Wait, but according to some sources, for even disks, the smallest moves to the right (peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0...), and for odd, to the left. Wait, maybe I got that reversed. Let me check the search result [4], which mentions the iterative solution. It says for even disks, the smallest moves to the right, so starting with moving disk 1 to peg 1. Then the next non-smallest move would be disk 2, but where can it go? The only legal move is from peg 0 to peg 2, since peg 1 has disk 1 which is smaller. So move disk 2 to peg 2. Then move disk 1 to peg 2 on top of disk 2. Then move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1. Then disk 1 to peg 0, disk 2 to peg 1, disk 1 to peg 1, disk 4 to peg 2, and so on. 

This pattern continues, alternating between moving the smallest disk and the next available disk. Each time, after moving the smallest, the next move is the only possible legal move for the non-smallest disk. This needs to be repeated until all disks are on peg 2.

But manually listing all 255 moves is error-prone. However, since the user requires the full list, I need to generate it programmatically. But since I can't execute code here, I have to rely on the recursive approach or find a pattern. Alternatively, the search result [5] provides a step-by-step for the iterative approach. For example, their example for 3 disks starts with moving disk 1 to the right, then disk 2, then disk 1 again, etc. Applying that to 8 disks, each cycle involves moving the smallest disk in a direction, then the next available disk.

Another approach is to use the recursive solution: move n-1 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary. Then move disk n from peg 0 to peg 2. Then move n-1 disks from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary. For 8 disks, this would generate the correct sequence, but the exact move list needs to be generated step by step.

But generating the exact list of 255 moves manually is impractical. However, perhaps the search results provide a pattern or an algorithm that can be followed. For example, result [5] mentions an algorithm where you alternate moving the smallest disk and the next possible disk. For even disks, the smallest moves to the right (peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0...), and for odd, to the left. Since 8 is even, the smallest disk (1) moves right each time.

So the pattern would be:

1. Move disk 1 from current peg to next peg (right).
2. Make the only possible move that doesn't involve disk 1.
3. Repeat until all disks are moved.

Following this, each cycle involves moving disk 1, then another disk. Let's try to outline the first few moves:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 1.
2. Move 2 from 0 to 2.
3. Move 1 from 1 to 2.
4. Move 3 from 0 to 1.
5. Move 1 from 2 to 0.
6. Move 2 from 2 to 1.
7. Move 1 from 0 to 1.
8. Move 4 from 0 to 2.
... and so on.

This pattern continues, with each even step moving a larger disk, and the odd steps moving disk 1 in a rightward direction. Continuing this pattern for 8 disks would generate all 255 moves. However, ensuring that each move is correct and adheres to the rules is crucial. Each time a larger disk is moved, it must be placed on an empty peg or a larger disk.

Given the complexity, the correct approach is to follow the iterative algorithm strictly, ensuring that each move alternates between the smallest disk and the next legal move. Since the user requires the complete list, I'll need to generate each move step by step according to this pattern, resulting in 255 moves in total.
