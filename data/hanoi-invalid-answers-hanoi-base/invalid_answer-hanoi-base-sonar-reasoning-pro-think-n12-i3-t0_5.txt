Okay, so I need to figure out the sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 12 disks. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Tower of Hanoi problem.

First, the classic solution for Tower of Hanoi is recursive. For n disks, you move the top n-1 disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the target peg, and finally move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg. This approach takes 2^n - 1 moves, which for 12 disks would be 4095 moves. That's a lot!

But the user wants the actual list of moves in the specified format: [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]. Generating such a list manually would be impossible, but maybe there's a pattern or an iterative approach that can be followed.

Looking at the search results, the Wikipedia article mentions that the minimum number of moves is 2^n - 1. For 12 disks, that's 4095 moves. The iterative solution described involves alternating between moving the smallest disk and another valid move. The direction depends on whether the number of disks is even or odd. Since 12 is even, the smallest disk should always move to the right (peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0, etc.).

Another point from the search results: the iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only legal move possible with the remaining disks. For each step, you move the smallest disk in a consistent direction (right for even n), then make the only possible move with the non-smallest disk.

So, the algorithm would be something like:

1. Initialize the pegs with all disks on peg 0.
2. While the puzzle isn't solved:
   a. Move the smallest disk (disk 1) to the next peg in the direction (right for even n).
   b. Make the only valid move possible that doesn't involve the smallest disk.
   c. Repeat until all disks are on peg 2.

But how to translate this into the specific moves with disk numbers and peg indices?

Wait, the example given in the query for 3 disks uses moves like [1,0,2], [2,0,1], etc. Each move specifies the disk number, source peg, and target peg. So, the disk numbers are from 1 (smallest) to 12 (largest), and pegs are 0-indexed.

The challenge is to generate the sequence of moves for 12 disks following the iterative approach. However, manually generating 4095 moves isn't feasible. Instead, I need to find a pattern or formula that can describe each move step.

Another approach is to use the binary representation of the move numbers. Each move corresponds to a bit in the binary count up to 2^n -1. The position of the least significant 1 in the binary representation determines which disk to move. But I'm not sure how to apply this directly to peg movements.

Alternatively, for the iterative method:

- For even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a cyclic right direction (0→1→2→0...).
- After each move of the smallest disk, there's only one possible move with the other disks.

So, starting with all disks on peg 0:

Move 1: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (smallest disk, first move to the right).
Then, the next move must be the only possible non-smallest disk move. Since disk 1 is on peg 1, the other disks are on peg 0 and 2. The only possible move is between peg 0 and peg 2. The top of peg 0 is disk 2, and peg 2 is empty. So move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.

Move 2: [2,0,2]
Then move disk 1 again to the next peg (right), which is peg 2.

Move 3: [1,1,2]
Next, the non-smallest move: between peg 0 and peg 1. The top of peg 0 is disk 3, and peg 1 is empty. So move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1.

Move 4: [3,0,1]
Continue this pattern.

But this seems tedious to do manually for 12 disks. However, there must be a systematic way to generate each move. Let's try to outline the pattern for a few moves and see if a formula emerges.

For 3 disks (as in the example), the moves are:

1. 1 from 0 to 2
2. 2 from 0 to 1
3. 1 from 2 to 1
4. 3 from 0 to 2
5. 1 from 1 to 0
6. 2 from 1 to 2
7. 1 from 0 to 2

Which matches the example given. The pattern here alternates moving the smallest disk and then the next possible move.

So, for 12 disks, the sequence would follow the same logic but with 4095 moves. Each move of the smallest disk is every other move, and the direction cycles right (since 12 is even).

But how to translate this into the exact list of moves? Since doing this manually is impossible, perhaps the answer is to recognize that the iterative approach can be implemented algorithmically, and the moves can be generated following specific rules.

Alternatively, the recursive approach can generate the moves by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. For example, moving 11 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, then disk 12 from peg 0 to peg 2, then moving the 11 disks from peg 1 to peg 2. Each of those subproblems would involve the same recursive steps.

However, the user requires the complete list of moves. Since the number of moves is 4095, it's impractical to list them all here. But perhaps the answer expects the recognition of the pattern and the total number of moves, along with an example of the first few and last few moves, but the user's example for 3 disks includes the full list. Wait, in the query's example, they provided the full list for 3 disks. So maybe the answer should provide the full list for 12 disks, but that's impossible due to length. However, the user's query says "Find the sequence of moves", so perhaps the answer is to provide the algorithm and the number of moves, but given the example in the query, they expect the actual list.

But given the constraints, it's impossible to write out 4095 moves here. Therefore, perhaps the answer should outline the method to generate the moves and provide the first few and last few steps as an example, along with the total number of moves. However, the user's example for 3 disks includes the full list, so maybe the answer should follow that.

Wait, the search results mention that the minimum number of moves is 2^n -1. For 12 disks, that's 4095 moves. The iterative solution is described, which alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only legal non-smallest move.

Given that, the answer should explain the method and then provide the complete list of moves. But how? It's impossible to list 4095 moves here. Therefore, perhaps the answer should provide the algorithm and state that the complete list follows the iterative method with 4095 moves, and perhaps provide a way to generate them programmatically.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects the recursive approach's move list. But again, generating it here isn't feasible.

Wait, the query's example for 3 disks has 7 moves, which is 2^3 -1 =7. The provided example lists all 7 moves. So for 12 disks, the answer should list all 4095 moves? That's impractical. Therefore, perhaps the answer should state that due to the length, the complete list is too long to provide here, but outline the method to generate it, and perhaps provide a sample of the first few and last few moves.

But the user's requirements say: "Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]".

Hmm, this is conflicting. The user wants the complete list, but with 4095 entries, it's impossible to write here. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the query, or maybe it's a test. Alternatively, maybe the answer should provide the algorithm and a way to generate the moves, perhaps with code.

Looking at the search results, one of the YouTube videos (result 3) shows a 12-disk solution animated. But the transcript isn't helpful. The Instructables link (result 4) provides steps but not the move list.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer should recognize that the solution follows the standard Tower of Hanoi recursive algorithm, and the moves can be generated by implementing that algorithm. However, without actual code, it's impossible to list all moves here.

Wait, the user's example uses disk IDs as 1,2,3, etc., and the pegs are 0-indexed. The recursive approach would generate the moves correctly. For example, moving n disks from source to target using auxiliary:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}")
        return
    hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
    print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}")
    hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

For n=3, this would generate the moves in the example. But for n=12, the output would be 4095 moves, which can't be listed here.

Therefore, the answer must acknowledge that the complete list is too lengthy but provide the method to generate it. However, the user's query explicitly asks for the sequence of moves, so perhaps the answer should provide a way to generate it programmatically, along with an explanation.

Alternatively, maybe the answer can provide the moves in a compressed format or note that it follows the standard solution. However, the user's example includes the full list, so perhaps the answer should follow suit, but given the impracticality, there must be another approach.

Wait, looking back at the search results, the Wikipedia page mentions the iterative solution steps. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a cyclic right direction. The steps are:

1. Move the smallest disk to the next peg (right for even n).
2. Make the only possible move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.
3. Repeat until solved.

Using this, we can outline the first few moves for 12 disks:

Move 1: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
Move 2: Move the smallest possible disk that's not 1 (but wait, step 2 is to move the non-smallest disk. So after moving disk 1, the next move is the only legal move not involving disk 1. At this point, pegs are:

Peg 0: 12,11,...,2
Peg 1: 1
Peg 2: empty

The only possible move is between peg 0 and peg 2. The top disk of peg 0 is 2, so move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.

Move 2: [2,0,2]

Move 3: Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2 (next in the right direction).

Move 3: [1,1,2]

Move 4: Now, the non-smallest move. The pegs are:

Peg 0: 12,11,...,3
Peg 1: empty
Peg 2: 1,2

The only possible move is between peg 0 and peg 1. Top of peg 0 is 3, so move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1.

Move 4: [3,0,1]

Move 5: Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0 (next right direction: peg 2 → peg 0 since it's even).

Move 5: [1,2,0]

Move 6: Non-smallest move. Peg 0 has 1, peg 1 has 3, peg 2 has 2. The possible move is between peg 1 and peg 2. Since 3 can't go on 2, but 2 can go on 3. Wait, disk 2 is on peg 2, and disk 3 is on peg 1. So the only legal move is to move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1 (since 2 < 3). Wait, but peg 1 has disk 3, which is larger, so yes.

Move 6: [2,2,1]

Move 7: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (next right direction: peg 0 → peg 1).

Move 7: [1,0,1]

Move 8: Non-smallest move. Now, pegs are:

Peg 0: 12,...,4
Peg 1: 1,2,3
Peg 2: empty

The only move is between peg 0 and peg 2. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2.

Move 8: [4,0,2]

This pattern continues, with the smallest disk moving right each time, and the non-smallest move being the only legal one. However, tracking this for 12 disks would require a programmatic approach.

Given that, the answer must explain the method and perhaps provide a code snippet that generates the moves. The user's query example includes a moves list, so the answer should follow that format but acknowledge the length.

But the user's requirements state that the answer must include the complete list of moves. Since that's impractical, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the recognition that the solution requires 4095 moves following the iterative method, and the exact sequence can be generated using the algorithm described.

Therefore, the answer should explain the method, state the number of moves, and provide the algorithm to generate the moves, possibly with a code example. However, the user's example shows the full list, so maybe the answer should provide a partial list and indicate that the full list follows the same pattern.

But given the constraints, the answer must comply with the user's instructions. Therefore, the correct approach is to provide the complete list of moves, but since that's impossible here, perhaps the answer should outline the method and note that the full list can be generated programmatically, providing an example of the first few and last few moves.

However, the user's query explicitly says to "Find the sequence of moves", and the example includes the full list. Therefore, the assistant must provide the full list, but given the impracticality, this suggests that the assistant should recognize the impossibility and explain the method instead.

But the user might be expecting the answer to provide the moves in the required format, even if it's long. However, in the context of this platform, providing such a long answer isn't feasible. Therefore, the answer should explain the method and provide a way to generate the moves, perhaps with a code snippet.

Looking at the search results, result 5's transcript mentions a recursive visualization. The recursive approach is the standard way to solve Tower of Hanoi. Therefore, the code to generate the moves would be a recursive function.

Here's a Python function that generates the moves:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(12, 0, 2, 1, moves)
print(moves)

This code would generate all 4095 moves. However, the output would be a list of moves where each move is [disk, from, to]. But in the user's example, the moves for 3 disks are:

[[1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2], [1,1,0], [2,1,2], [1,0,2]]

But according to the recursive function, the moves for 3 disks would be:

Move 1: Move disk 1 from 0 to 2
Move 2: Move disk 2 from 0 to 1
Move 3: Move disk 1 from 2 to 1
Move 4: Move disk 3 from 0 to 2
Move 5: Move disk 1 from 1 to 0
Move 6: Move disk 2 from 1 to 2
Move 7: Move disk 1 from 0 to 2

Which matches the example. Therefore, the recursive approach generates the correct sequence.

Thus, the answer should explain that the solution follows the recursive method and provide the code to generate the moves. However, the user wants the actual list. Since it's too long, the answer should provide the code and note that running it will generate the complete list.

But the user's query requires the list in the answer. Given the constraints, the answer must comply. Therefore, the assistant must provide the list, but given the length, it's impossible. This suggests that the assistant should recognize this and explain that the complete list can be generated using the provided code, and perhaps include a sample of the first few and last few moves.

Alternatively, the assistant might have access to a precomputed list, but that's unlikely. Therefore, the correct answer is to explain the method, provide the code, and state that the complete list has 4095 moves generated by the code.

The Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 12 disks requires 4095 moves to solve optimally, following the recursive algorithm. The solution involves repeatedly moving smaller sub-stacks to auxiliary pegs until the largest disk reaches its destination. Here's the complete sequence of moves generated by the recursive method:
