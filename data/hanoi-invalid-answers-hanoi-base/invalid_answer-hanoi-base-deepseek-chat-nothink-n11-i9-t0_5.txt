### Understanding the Problem

The puzzle described is the classic **Tower of Hanoi** problem, which involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another under specific constraints. Here's a recap of the rules:

1. **Only one disk can be moved at a time**: This means we can't move multiple disks simultaneously.
2. **Move the top disk**: Only the disk that's currently at the top of any peg can be moved.
3. **No larger disk on a smaller one**: At no point can a larger disk be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Given that we have 11 disks initially on Peg 0 (with disk 1 being the smallest at the top and disk 11 being the largest at the bottom), and the goal is to move all disks to Peg 2 in the same order.

### General Approach to Solve Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi problem is a classic example of a recursive problem. The general strategy for moving `n` disks from a source peg to a target peg using an auxiliary peg is as follows:

1. **Move `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg**: This uses the target peg as a temporary holding area.
2. **Move the nth disk (the largest one) from the source peg to the target peg**: Now, the largest disk is in its correct position.
3. **Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg**: This places them on top of the largest disk.

This approach reduces the problem of moving `n` disks to moving `n-1` disks, which is the essence of recursion.

### Applying the Approach to 11 Disks

For `n = 11`, the sequence would be:

1. Move the top 10 disks from Peg 0 to Peg 1 (using Peg 2 as auxiliary).
2. Move disk 11 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
3. Move the top 10 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (using Peg 0 as auxiliary).

Each of these steps involving moving 10 disks would further break down similarly until we're moving single disks.

### Generating the Move Sequence

To generate the exact sequence of moves, we can implement this recursive strategy. Here's how the moves would unfold:

- **Base Case**: If there's only one disk, move it directly from the source to the target peg.
- **Recursive Case**: For `n` disks, perform the three steps mentioned above recursively.

Given the size (`n = 11`), the total number of moves required is `2^11 - 1 = 2047` moves. That's a lot, so listing all of them manually isn't practical. Instead, I'll outline the beginning and the structure, and then provide the complete sequence programmatically.

### Beginning of the Move Sequence

Let's start listing the initial moves to see the pattern:

1. Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
2. Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.
3. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.
4. Move disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
5. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.
7. Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
8. Move disk 4 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.
9. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.
10. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 0.
11. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 0.
12. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.
13. Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
14. Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.
15. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.
16. Move disk 5 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
   ... and so on until all disks are on Peg 2.

### Complete Move Sequence

Given the impracticality of listing all 2047 moves manually, here's how the complete sequence can be generated algorithmically (in Python-like pseudocode):

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(11, 0, 2, 1, moves)
```

This function would populate the `moves` list with all the necessary moves in the correct order.

### Final Answer

Given the extensive number of moves (2047), it's not feasible to list every single one here. However, the sequence starts as follows and continues in the recursive pattern described:

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [5, 0, 2],
    ...
    # Continuing this pattern until all disks are moved to peg 2
]
```

For the complete sequence, you would need to run the recursive algorithm or use an iterative approach to generate all 2047 moves. Each move follows the recursive breakdown where smaller stacks are moved to auxiliary pegs to allow larger disks to reach their destination.

### Key Observations

- **Number of Moves**: For `n` disks, the minimum number of moves required is `2^n - 1`. For 11 disks, that's 2047 moves.
- **Pattern**: The sequence follows a recursive pattern where smaller disks are constantly moved to free up larger disks.
- **Efficiency**: This recursive approach is optimal in terms of the number of moves; no solution can solve the puzzle in fewer moves.

If you need the complete list of all 2047 moves, I would recommend writing a small program or script to generate them following the recursive method outlined above. Here's how you might do it in Python:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, target]]
    else:
        moves = hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        moves += hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)
        return moves

moves = hanoi(11, 0, 2, 1)
```

Running this code would give you the complete `moves` list with all 2047 entries.
