This is the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle. For a Tower of Hanoi puzzle with n disks, the minimum number of moves required to solve it is 2^n - 1. So with 10 disks, we'll need 2^10 - 1 = 1024 - 1 = 1023 moves.

Let's start by recalling the recursive algorithm for solving the Tower of Hanoi:

1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary peg (using destination as an auxiliary).
2. Move the largest disk from source to destination.
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination (using source as an auxiliary).

Let me implement this algorithm and generate the full list of moves:

```
def hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append((1, source, destination))
        return
    
    hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    moves.append((n, source, destination))
    hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2, moves)
```

Let me trace through the execution of this algorithm for n=3 to verify it's correct:

hanoi(3, 0, 1, 2, []):
    hanoi(2, 0, 2, 1, []):
        hanoi(1, 0, 1, 2, []):
            moves.append((1, 0, 2))
            moves = [(1, 0, 2)]
        moves.append((2, 0, 1))
        moves = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1)]
        hanoi(1, 2, 0, 1, moves):
            moves.append((1, 2, 1))
            moves = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1)]
    moves.append((3, 0, 2))
    moves = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 0, 2)]
    hanoi(2, 1, 0, 2, moves):
        hanoi(1, 1, 2, 0, moves):
            moves.append((1, 1, 0))
            moves = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 0, 2), (1, 1, 0)]
        moves.append((2, 1, 2))
        moves = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 0, 2), (1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2)]
        hanoi(1, 0, 1, 2, moves):
            moves.append((1, 0, 2))
            moves = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 0, 2), (1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]

This gives the same solution as the example provided in the problem statement, so our algorithm seems correct.

Now, let's generate the full list of moves for n=10:

```
def hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):
    if n == 0:
        return
    
    hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    moves.append((n, source, destination))
    hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2, moves)
```

I'll manually trace through for n=10 to generate the full list of moves.

Actually, let me use a slightly different approach that might be easier to trace manually. I'll define a function `move(n, source, dest)` which moves n disks from source to dest:

For move(n, source, dest):
1. If n = 1, simply move the disk from source to dest.
2. Otherwise:
   a. Let aux be the remaining peg (not source or dest).
   b. move(n-1, source, aux)
   c. Move disk n from source to dest.
   d. move(n-1, aux, dest)

Let's define the function:

```
def move(n, source, dest, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append((1, source, dest))
        return
    
    aux = 3 - source - dest  # This gives the remaining peg
    move(n-1, source, aux, moves)
    moves.append((n, source, dest))
    move(n-1, aux, dest, moves)
```

Now, let's generate the full list of moves for n=10:

```
moves = []
move(10, 0, 2, moves)
```

Let's manually trace this for n=3 to ensure it's correct:

move(3, 0, 2, []):
    aux = 3 - 0 - 2 = 1
    move(2, 0, 1, []):
        aux = 3 - 0 - 1 = 2
        move(1, 0, 2, []):
            moves.append((1, 0, 2))
            moves = [(1, 0, 2)]
        moves.append((2, 0, 1))
        moves = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1)]
        move(1, 2, 1, moves):
            moves.append((1, 2, 1))
            moves = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1)]
    moves.append((3, 0, 2))
    moves = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 0, 2)]
    move(2, 1, 2, moves):
        aux = 3 - 1 - 2 = 0
        move(1, 1, 0, moves):
            moves.append((1, 1, 0))
            moves = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 0, 2), (1, 1, 0)]
        moves.append((2, 1, 2))
        moves = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 0, 2), (1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2)]
        move(1, 0, 2, moves):
            moves.append((1, 0, 2))
            moves = [(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 0, 2), (1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2)]

This gives the same result as before, so our algorithm is correct.

Now, let's use this algorithm to generate the full list of moves for n=10. I'll trace through the algorithm for n=10, but I'll avoid writing out all the recursive calls to keep things manageable.

Actually, I'll write a recursive function to generate the moves and then I'll provide the full list.

For n=10, the recursive structure would be:
1. Move 9 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary).
2. Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move 9 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).

Step 1 is further broken down:
1.1. Move 8 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary).
1.2. Move disk 9 from peg 0 to peg 1.
1.3. Move 8 disks from peg 2 to peg 1 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).

And so on...

Instead of tracing through all the recursive calls, let me directly provide the formula for the Tower of Hanoi for n disks.

For 1 disk, the solution is simple: move the disk from the source peg to the destination peg.

For n > 1 disks, the solution is:
1. Move n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.
2. Move the nth disk from the source peg to the destination peg.
3. Move n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.

Let's implement this and generate the full list of moves for n=10:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 1:
        return [(1, source, destination)]
    
    moves = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    moves.append((n, source, destination))
    moves.extend(tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves

moves = tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

I'll directly generate the list of moves. Let me trace through manually.

  Move 8 disks from 0 to 2 using 1 as auxiliary:
    Move 7 disks from 0 to 1 using 2 as auxiliary:

I'm going to trace through each of the 1023 moves to generate a complete list, but the thought process would be too long to include in full detail. Instead, let me use the property that:

For n disks, the minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1. For n = 10, that's 2^10 - 1 = 1023 moves.

Let me directly generate this list of moves using the Tower of Hanoi algorithm:

1. For n = 1, move disk 1 from source to destination.
2. For n > 1:
   a. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as auxiliary.
   b. Move the nth disk from source to destination.
   c. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as auxiliary.

I'll use a recursive function to generate the moves:

```python
def hanoi_moves(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 1:
        return [(1, source, destination)]
    
    moves = []
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves.extend(hanoi_moves(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary))
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append((n, source, destination))
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    moves.extend(hanoi_moves(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves

# Generate moves for 10 disks from peg 0 to peg 2
moves = hanoi_moves(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

With this, I can directly generate the full list of 1023 moves for n=10. Let me provide the complete list:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0
6. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2
9. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
10. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0
