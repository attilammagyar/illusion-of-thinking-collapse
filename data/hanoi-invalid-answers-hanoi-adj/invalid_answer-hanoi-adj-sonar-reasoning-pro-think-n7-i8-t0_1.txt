Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation. First, I remember that the minimum number of moves required for n disks is 2^n - 1. For 7 disks, that's 127 moves. So the solution should have exactly 127 moves.

The standard approach for Tower of Hanoi is using recursion: move n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the target peg, and then move the n-1 disks onto the target peg. But since the user wants an explicit list, I need to generate each step.

Looking at the search results, the iterative solution mentioned in source [4] alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Since 7 is odd, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move in a clockwise direction (peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0, etc.).

But wait, the example given in the query for 3 disks uses a specific sequence. Let me check that. The example moves are [[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2]]. That seems to follow the standard recursive method. For 3 disks, the moves are:

1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2

So the recursive approach breaks down the problem into moving smaller towers. For 7 disks, this would involve a lot of repetitive steps. But generating each move manually is error-prone. However, the user insists on the complete list, so I need to find a way to generate all 127 moves correctly.

Another approach mentioned in the sources is the iterative method. Source [4] says for an odd number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a clockwise direction. Each move alternates between the smallest disk and the next possible disk. Let's see how that works.

For 7 disks (odd), the smallest disk (1) moves clockwise: 0 → 1 → 2 → 0 → 1 → 2, etc. After each move of disk 1, the next move is the only legal move possible with the remaining disks. This iterative method might be easier to implement programmatically, but since I'm doing this manually, I need to ensure each step follows the rules.

Alternatively, the recursive solution can be represented as a series of moves. The recursive algorithm for moving n disks from source to target using auxiliary is:

1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using target.
2. Move disk n from source to target.
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target using source.

Applying this recursively for each n. For 7 disks, this would generate the correct sequence. But how to translate that into the exact list of moves?

Let's consider the pattern for smaller numbers. For 1 disk, it's just one move. For 2 disks: move 1 from 0→1, move 2 from 0→2, move 1 from 1→2. For 3 disks as in the example, the sequence is longer. The pattern alternates between moving smaller disks and the next largest.

But generating this for 7 disks manually would take a long time. However, the search results mention that the solution for 7 disks is available in the provided sources. Source [1] is a video showing the solution for 7 disks. Source [2] describes steps for a 7-disk puzzle, mentioning moving disk 1 left, then disk 2, etc., following an algorithm. Source [3] is another video tutorial for 7 disks.

Looking at source [2], the steps involve moving disk 1 in a circular pattern. For an odd number of disks, disk 1 moves left (from peg 0 to peg 2, then peg 2 to peg 1, then peg 1 to peg 0, etc.? Wait, the description says for even numbers, disk 1 moves right, and for odd, left. But the exact direction might depend on the parity.

Wait, source [2] says: "Of course, for puzzles with an Even number of disks the movements would be reversed but would follow the same pattern. Disk 1 would jump from the leftmost peg to the right, landing on the middle peg. From the middle peg it would move right onto the rightmost peg, and then back around to the leftmost peg again to complete the circular sequence..."

But for odd disks (like 7), the movement is different. The initial step for 7 disks would involve moving disk 1 to the left (from peg 0 to peg 2?), but I need to confirm.

Alternatively, the iterative solution from source [4] states that for an odd number of disks, the smallest piece moves in a clockwise direction (right), and for even, counter-clockwise (left). Wait, the exact direction might vary based on the initial setup. The example in the query uses peg 0 as source and peg 2 as target. So for 7 disks (odd), the smallest disk moves in a clockwise direction: 0→1, 1→2, 2→0, etc.

But I need to make sure each move is correct. Let's try to outline the steps for 7 disks using the iterative method:

1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 1 (if even, it would be to 2, but since 7 is odd, direction is different? Wait, source [4] says: "If there is no tower position in the chosen direction, move the piece to the opposite end, but then continue to move in the correct direction." So for odd, the direction is to the right. So first move is 0→1, then 1→2, then 2→0, etc.

But this is getting confusing. Maybe the standard recursive approach is better. Let's think recursively.

For moving 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 2:

- Move 6 disks from 0 to 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary).
- Move disk 7 from 0 to 2.
- Move 6 disks from 1 to 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).

Each of these steps involves breaking down into smaller problems. For example, moving 6 disks from 0 to 1 requires moving 5 disks from 0 to 2, then disk 6 to 1, then 5 disks from 2 to 1, and so on.

This recursive breakdown would generate the correct sequence, but listing all 127 moves is tedious. However, the user requires the complete list. Since the search results mention that the solution for 7 disks is available, perhaps the exact sequence can be derived from the sources.

Source [2] provides a step-by-step for 7 disks, but the text is cut off. It mentions moving disk 1 left, then disk 2, etc., following an algorithm. The key is to alternate moving the smallest disk and the next available disk. For 7 disks, the sequence would follow this pattern, with disk 1 moving in a specific direction each time.

Alternatively, the iterative algorithm can be implemented as follows:

- While the game isn't solved:
  - Move the smallest disk to the next peg in the direction (clockwise for odd, counter for even).
  - Make the only legal move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

But to generate the exact list, I need to simulate this process.

Let's attempt to simulate the moves step by step for 7 disks.

Since 7 is odd, the smallest disk (1) moves clockwise: 0 → 1 → 2 → 0 → 1 → 2, etc.

The steps would be:

1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 1.
2. Move the next possible disk (smallest non-1). The only legal move is disk 2 from 0 to 2.
3. Move disk 1 from 1 to 2.
4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 1.
5. Move disk 1 from 2 to 0.
6. Move disk 2 from 2 to 1.
7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 1.
8. Move disk 4 from 0 to 2.
9. ... and so on.

This pattern continues, with each even-numbered step moving the next available disk, and odd steps moving disk 1. However, manually simulating 127 steps is error-prone. But perhaps there's a pattern or formula to generate each move.

Alternatively, the recursive approach can be represented as a binary tree, where each move corresponds to a node. Each disk's movement is determined by its position in the binary representation of the move number. For example, the nth move corresponds to the binary representation of n, and the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in binary.

But this might be more complex. Alternatively, using the fact that each disk moves every 2^(k-1) steps, where k is the disk number. For disk 1 (smallest), it moves every 1 step. Disk 2 every 2 steps, disk 3 every 4 steps, etc. The direction of each disk's movement alternates based on its size. For 7 disks, which is odd, the direction for disk 1 is clockwise (right), and larger disks move in the opposite direction when necessary.

But how to determine the exact sequence? Let's consider that each disk's moves alternate between two pegs. For disk 1, moving clockwise: 0→1→2→0→1→2...

For disk 2, it moves every 2 steps. The direction depends on the parity of the number of disks. Since 7 is odd, disk 2's first move is from 0→2 (since after disk 1 moves to 1, disk 2 can move to 2). Then disk 2 moves from 2→1, then 1→0, etc.

But this is getting too vague. Maybe the best approach is to refer to the sources provided. Source [1] is a video showing the solution for 7 disks. While I can't watch the video, the description says it's the simplest and most optimum solution. Similarly, source [3] is another video tutorial. The text from source [2] describes steps for a 7-disk puzzle, mentioning moving disk 1 left, then disk 2, etc., following an algorithm.

Given that the user insists on the complete list and the sources provide the solution, I need to generate the exact sequence. However, without the actual move list from the sources, I have to rely on the standard recursive solution.

Let me outline the recursive solution for 7 disks:

To move 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 2:

1. Move 6 disks from 0 to 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary).
2. Move disk 7 from 0 to 2.
3. Move 6 disks from 1 to 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).

To move 6 disks from 0 to 1:

1. Move 5 disks from 0 to 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary).
2. Move disk 6 from 0 to 1.
3. Move 5 disks from 2 to 1 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).

This recursion continues until we reach the base case of moving 1 disk. Each time, the moves for the smaller disks are generated recursively.

However, translating this into the exact list of 127 moves is challenging. Each recursive step interleaves moves from different levels. For example, moving 7 disks involves moving 6 disks twice, each of which involves moving 5 disks four times, and so on.

Alternatively, the iterative approach can be simulated step by step. Let's try to generate the first few moves and see the pattern.

For 7 disks (odd), direction is clockwise (right). So disk 1 moves 0→1→2→0→1→2...

Move 1: disk 1 from 0→1
Move 2: disk 2 from 0→2 (only legal move)
Move 3: disk 1 from 1→2
Move 4: disk 3 from 0→1
Move 5: disk 1 from 2→0
Move 6: disk 2 from 2→1
Move 7: disk 1 from 0→1
Move 8: disk 4 from 0→2
Move 9: disk 1 from 1→2
Move 10: disk 2 from 1→0
Move 11: disk 1 from 2→0
Move 12: disk 3 from 1→2
Move 13: disk 1 from 0→1
Move 14: disk 2 from 0→2
Move 15: disk 1 from 1→2
Move 16: disk 5 from 0→1
...

Continuing this pattern, each time a larger disk is moved when possible, alternating with moves of disk 1. This would eventually lead to all disks on peg 2. However, manually listing all 127 steps is impractical, but the user requires it.

Given that the sources mention the solution for 7 disks and the iterative method, I can conclude that the correct sequence follows the iterative approach, alternating between moving disk 1 and the next available disk. The exact list can be generated programmatically, but since I have to provide it here, I'll need to rely on the standard solution.

The example for 3 disks in the query has 7 moves. For 7 disks, the optimal solution has 127 moves. The exact sequence can be found in the sources, but since I can't access the video content, I'll have to construct it based on the described methods.

In conclusion, the correct sequence of moves for 7 disks is the standard optimal solution generated by the recursive or iterative method, resulting in 127 moves. Each move follows the rules, ensuring no larger disk is placed on a smaller one. The exact list is lengthy, but adhering to the user's request, I'll provide the complete sequence as per the standard solution.
