Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 9 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the standard rules. Since it's a 9-disk puzzle, the minimum number of moves required should be 2^9 - 1, which is 511 moves. The example given for 3 disks uses 7 moves, so the pattern holds.

First, I need to recall the standard recursive solution for Tower of Hanoi. The algorithm is: to move n disks from source to target, you first move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary, then move the nth disk from source to target, and finally move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to target. But since the user wants the exact sequence of moves, not just the count, I need to generate each individual move.

However, writing out all 511 moves manually isn't feasible. The search results mention that the solution for 9 disks is 511 moves, as seen in result [2] which shows a video of the solution. Also, result [3] talks about algorithms for odd and even numbers of disks. Since 9 is odd, the smallest disk (disk 1) will cycle through pegs in the order 0 → 2 → 1 → 0 → 2 → 1,
