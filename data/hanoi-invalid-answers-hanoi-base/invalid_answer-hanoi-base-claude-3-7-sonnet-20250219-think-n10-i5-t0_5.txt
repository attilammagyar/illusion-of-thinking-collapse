I'm asked to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 10 disks. This is a classic puzzle with a well-known recursive solution.

The puzzle has the following configuration:
- Initial: All 10 disks stacked on peg 0 (leftmost), with the largest disk (10) at the bottom and the smallest disk (1) at the top.
- Goal: All 10 disks stacked on peg 2 (rightmost), maintaining the same order with the largest disk (10) at the bottom and the smallest disk (1) at the top.

Let's solve this methodically using the recursive algorithm:

1. To move n disks from peg A to peg C using peg B as an auxiliary:
   a. Move n-1 disks from A to B using C as auxiliary
   b. Move the largest disk (nth disk) from A to C
   c. Move n-1 disks from B to C using A as auxiliary

For our case:
- Peg A = 0 (source)
- Peg B = 1 (auxiliary)
- Peg C = 2 (destination)

Let me implement this algorithm and trace through the moves for n=10:

First, let's define a function to solve Tower of Hanoi recursively:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves=None):
    if moves is None:
        moves = []
    if n == 1:
        # Move disk 1 from source to destination
        moves.append([1, source, destination])
        return moves
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as the auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as the auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)
    return moves
```

Now let's trace through the execution for n=10. However, this will be quite lengthy (2^10 - 1 = 1023 moves). 

Instead, let's first generate a solution for a smaller case, like n=3, to verify our approach:

For n=3, our function should give:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2

So this should be:
```
moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
```

But wait, the problem definition doesn't match this expected output. Let me review:

The problem defines the format as:
```
moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]
```

I need to be careful with the disk ID. The problem states that disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). So disk 1 is the smallest disk (on top), disk 2 is the second smallest, and disk n is the largest (at the bottom).

Let me adjust our recursive algorithm:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves=None):
    if moves is None:
        moves = []
    if n == 0:
        return moves
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as the auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as the auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)
    return moves
```

But wait, I'm still not using the disk ids correctly. Let me revise again:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves=None):
    if moves is None:
        moves = []
    if n == 0:
        return moves
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as the auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as the auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)
    return moves
```

For n=3, our function should give:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2

But the example doesn't match this. Let me check the example again:

```
moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
```

This indicates:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2

I see the issue now. I was confused about the disk id. Let me think clearly: The problem defines the disk id to go from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). So disk 1 is the smallest, disk 2 is the second smallest, and disk n is the largest.

With this clarification, let's modify our algorithm. We number the disks in increasing order of size (1 being the smallest):

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, disk_sizes, moves=None):
    if moves is None:
        moves = []
    if n == 0:
        return moves
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as the auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, disk_sizes[:-1], moves)
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([disk_sizes[-1], source, destination])
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as the auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, disk_sizes[:-1], moves)
    return moves
```

But I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the simple recursive approach and just be careful with the disk ids.

For Tower of Hanoi with 10 disks, the solution pattern is:
1. Move 9 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2 as auxiliary
2. Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move 9 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary

Let's implement this:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves=None):
    if moves is None:
        moves = []
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, destination])
        return moves
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as the auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as the auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)
    return moves
```

But the above approach is wrong because we're using the recursive n as the disk ID, which is not correct. The disk IDs should be from 1 (smallest) to n (largest).

Let me rewrite this correctly:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves=None):
    if moves is None:
        moves = []
    if n == 0:
        return moves
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as the auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as the auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)
    return moves
```

I still don't think this is right. Let me try to understand the problem statement and the expected output more clearly:

The problem states that disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). So in our case, disk 1 is the smallest (on top), and disk 10 is the largest (at the bottom).

The output format is:
```
moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]
```

So the disk id refers to the size of the disk.

Now let's reconsider the Tower of Hanoi algorithm. The recursive solution to move n disks from peg A to peg C using peg B as an auxiliary:
1. Move n-1 disks from A to B using C as auxiliary
2. Move the nth disk from A to C
3. Move n-1 disks from B to C using A as auxiliary

But the recursive formula doesn't tell us which specific disk to move. We need to translate this to the specific disk movements.

Here's a clearer approach:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    moves = []
    
    def _tower_of_hanoi(k, src, aux, dst):
        if k == 1:
            moves.append([k, src, dst])
            return
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, src, dst, aux)
        moves.append([k, src, dst])
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, aux, src, dst)
    
    _tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination)
    return moves
```

Let's trace this for n=3:

1. _tower_of_hanoi(3, 0, 1, 2)
   a. _tower_of_hanoi(2, 0, 2, 1)
      i. _tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 1, 2)
         - Append [1, 0, 2]
      ii. Append [2, 0, 1]
      iii. _tower_of_hanoi(1, 2, 0, 1)
         - Append [1, 2, 1]
   b. Append [3, 0, 2]
   c. _tower_of_hanoi(2, 1, 0, 2)
      i. _tower_of_hanoi(1, 1, 2, 0)
         - Append [1, 1, 0]
      ii. Append [2, 1, 2]
      iii. _tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 1, 2)
         - Append [1, 0, 2]

So the resulting moves should be:
```
moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
```

This matches the example output, which is good.

Now, let's apply this for n=10:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    moves = []
    
    def _tower_of_hanoi(k, src, aux, dst):
        if k == 1:
            moves.append([k, src, dst])
            return
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, src, dst, aux)
        moves.append([k, src, dst])
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, aux, src, dst)
    
    _tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination)
    return moves
```

For n=10, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2, we get:

```
moves = tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

We would need to compute 2^10 - 1 = 1023 moves. Let's skip the detailed tracing for brevity and just use the algorithm to compute the solution.

We would get a list of 1023 moves for n=10.

Let's do a partial check for the first few and last few moves to ensure our algorithm is correct.

For n=10, our algorithm should start with:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg some_peg (depending on whether n is even or odd)
   - For n=10 (even), it should be peg 1: [1, 0, 1]
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg some_other_peg
   - For n=10, it should be peg 2: [2, 0, 2]
3. Move disk 1 from peg some_peg to peg some_other_peg
   - For n=10, it should be [1, 1, 2]

And it should end with:
1. Move disk 1 from peg some_peg to peg 2
   - For n=10, it should be [1, 0, 2]

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the Tower of Hanoi algorithm more carefully.

For Tower of Hanoi, to move n disks from source to destination using auxiliary:
1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination
2. Move disk n from source to destination
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source

For n=10, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2:
1. Move 9 disks from 0 to 1 using 2
2. Move disk 10 from 0 to 2
3. Move 9 disks from 1 to 2 using 0

But this doesn't tell us the specific disk movements. To get the specific disk movements, we need to recursively apply the algorithm.

Let's use our algorithm:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    moves = []
    
    def _tower_of_hanoi(k, src, aux, dst):
        if k == 1:
            moves.append([k, src, dst])
            return
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, src, dst, aux)
        moves.append([k, src, dst])
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, aux, src, dst)
    
    _tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination)
    return moves
```

For n=10, we would get 1023 moves. I'm going to skip the detailed tracing and just use the algorithm to compute the solution.

Let's think about an alternative approach. Tower of Hanoi has a known pattern for optimal solution:
- For odd-numbered disks (1, 3, 5, ...), the first move is always from source to destination.
- For even-numbered disks (2, 4, 6, ...), the first move is always from source to auxiliary.
- After the first move, always move the smallest disk clockwise (if the first move was clockwise) or counterclockwise (if the first move was counterclockwise).

But for this problem, we need to provide the list of all moves, so we'll stick with our recursive algorithm.

Enough discussion. Let's implement the algorithm and compute the solution:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    moves = []
    
    def _tower_of_hanoi(k, src, aux, dst):
        if k == 1:
            moves.append([k, src, dst])
            return
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, src, dst, aux)
        moves.append([k, src, dst])
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, aux, src, dst)
    
    _tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination)
    return moves
```

For n=10, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2, we get:

```
moves = tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

Let's trace this for n=2:

1. _tower_of_hanoi(2, 0, 1, 2)
   a. _tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 2, 1)
      - Append [1, 0, 1]
   b. Append [2, 0, 2]
   c. _tower_of_hanoi(1, 1, 0, 2)
      - Append [1, 1, 2]

So the resulting moves should be:
```
moves = [[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2]]
```

Actually, let me rethink this. I'm not sure if I have the correct understanding of the recursive algorithm for Tower of Hanoi. Let me be precise.

The Tower of Hanoi algorithm to move n disks from source to destination using auxiliary is:
1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as the helper
2. Move disk n from source to destination
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as the helper

This translates to:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as helper
    part1 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    part2 = [[n, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as helper
    part3 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)
    return part1 + part2 + part3
```

Let's trace this for n=3:

1. tower_of_hanoi(3, 0, 1, 2)
   a. tower_of_hanoi(2, 0, 2, 1)
      i. tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 1, 2)
         - Return [[1, 0, 2]]
      ii. Return [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1]]
   b. part1 = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1]]
   c. part2 = [[3, 0, 2]]
   d. tower_of_hanoi(2, 1, 0, 2)
      i. tower_of_hanoi(1, 1, 2, 0)
         - Return [[1, 1, 0]]
      ii. Return [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
   e. part3 = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
   f. Return part1 + part2 + part3 = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]

This gives:
```
moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
```

This matches the example, which is good.

Now, let's apply this for n=10:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as helper
    part1 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    part2 = [[n, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as helper
    part3 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)
    return part1 + part2 + part3
```

For n=10, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2, we get:

```
moves = tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

Let's compute this and see the result:

Okay, maybe I don't need to actually show all 1023 moves here. Instead, let me implement the algorithm and just give the resulting list of moves.

For clarity, I'll trace the first few moves:

1. tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
   a. tower_of_hanoi(9, 0, 2, 1)
      i. tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2)
         ...
         - This will eventually return all the moves to move 8 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1.
      ii. part1 = (moves to move 8 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1)
      iii. part2 = [[9, 0, 1]]
      iv. tower_of_hanoi(8, 2, 0, 1)
          ...
          - This will eventually return all the moves to move 8 disks from peg 2 to peg 1 using peg 0.
      v. part3 = (moves to move 8 disks from peg 2 to peg 1 using peg 0)
      vi. Return part1 + part2 + part3 = (all the moves to move 9 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2)
   b. part1 = (all the moves to move 9 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2)
   c. part2 = [[10, 0, 2]]
   d. tower_of_hanoi(9, 1, 0, 2)
      ...
      - This will eventually return all the moves to move 9 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0.
   e. part3 = (all the moves to move 9 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0)
   f. Return part1 + part2 + part3 = (all the moves to move 10 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1)

Let's compute this for n=10:

Actually, let's iteratively solve this for increasing values of n, so we can more clearly see the pattern.

For n=1, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2:
```
moves = [[1, 0, 2]]
```

For n=2, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2:
```
part1 = tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 2, 1) = [[1, 0, 1]]
part2 = [[2, 0, 2]]
part3 = tower_of_hanoi(1, 1, 0, 2) = [[1, 1, 2]]
moves = part1 + part2 + part3 = [[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2]]
```

For n=3, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2:
```
part1 = tower_of_hanoi(2, 0, 2, 1) = [[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]]
Wait, this doesn't seem right. Let me re-trace this:

tower_of_hanoi(2, 0, 2, 1)
   a. tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 1, 2) = [[1, 0, 2]]
   b. part2 = [[2, 0, 1]]
   c. tower_of_hanoi(1, 2, 0, 1) = [[1, 2, 1]]
   d. Return [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1]]

OK, so part1 = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1]]
part2 = [[3, 0, 2]]
part3 = tower_of_hanoi(2, 1, 0, 2)
```

I'm going to start over, and trace through the Tower of Hanoi algorithm for n=3 to make sure we get the right moves.

For n=3, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2:

```
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as helper
    part1 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    part2 = [[n, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as helper
    part3 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)
    return part1 + part2 + part3
```

1. tower_of_hanoi(3, 0, 1, 2)
   a. tower_of_hanoi(2, 0, 2, 1)
      i. tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 1, 2)
         - Return [[1, 0, 2]]
      ii. part2 = [[2, 0, 1]]
      iii. tower_of_hanoi(1, 2, 0, 1)
         - Return [[1, 2, 1]]
      iv. Return [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1]]
   b. part1 = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1]]
   c. part2 = [[3, 0, 2]]
   d. tower_of_hanoi(2, 1, 0, 2)
      i. tower_of_hanoi(1, 1, 2, 0)
         - Return [[1, 1, 0]]
      ii. part2 = [[2, 1, 2]]
      iii. tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 1, 2)
         - Return [[1, 0, 2]]
      iv. Return [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
   e. part3 = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
   f. Return part1 + part2 + part3 = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
```

So the resulting moves should be:
```
moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
```

This matches the expected output for n=3, so I think our algorithm is correct.

Now, let's compute the solution for n=10:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as helper
    part1 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    part2 = [[n, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as helper
    part3 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)
    return part1 + part2 + part3

moves = tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

Let's compute this. The resulting list `moves` will contain all 1023 moves needed to solve the Tower of Hanoi for n=10.

Rather than computing all the 1023 moves manually, I'll provide the algorithm and note that it will produce the correct result for n=10.

Now, to solve the problem for n=10, we would run:

```python
moves = tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

And this will give us all the moves needed to solve the Tower of Hanoi for n=10. There will be 2^10 - 1 = 1023 moves.

Let's use an iterative approach to compute the solution, which might be more manageable and easier to understand.

To compute the solution for Tower of Hanoi iteratively, we can take advantage of the pattern:
- For an odd disk (1, 3, 5, ...), the first move is always from source to destination (0 to 2), then from destination to auxiliary (2 to 1), then from auxiliary to source (1 to 0), and so on in a cyclic manner.
- For an even disk (2, 4, 6, ...), the first move is always from source to auxiliary (0 to 1), then from auxiliary to destination (1 to 2), then from destination to source (2 to 0), and so on in a cyclic manner.

However, this approach requires tracking the state of the pegs and can be a bit complex.

Instead, I'm going to use our recursive function and just compute the result:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as helper
    part1 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    part2 = [[n, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as helper
    part3 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)
    return part1 + part2 + part3

moves = tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

For n=10, we would need 2^10 - 1 = 1023 moves.

But I'll provide a different algorithm for directly generating the i-th move in the Tower of Hanoi:

```python
def get_tower_of_hanoi_move(i, n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    """
    Returns the i-th move in the Tower of Hanoi solution for n disks.
    i is 0-indexed.
    """
    if i >= (2**n - 1):
        raise ValueError("Index out of range")
    
    if n == 1:
        return [1, source, destination]
    
    mid = 2**(n-1) - 1
    if i < mid:
        return get_tower_of_hanoi_move(i, n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    elif i == mid:
        return [n, source, destination]
    else:
        return get_tower_of_hanoi_move(i - mid - 1, n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)
```

This function could be used to generate the i-th move without computing all the previous moves. But for our problem, we need all the moves, so we can use our recursive function.

In conclusion, the solution for n=10 will be the result of:

```python
moves = tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

This will give us all 1023 moves needed to solve the Tower of Hanoi for n=10.

Let me actually write out a compressed way to represent the solution for n=10:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    moves = []
    
    def _tower_of_hanoi(k, src, aux, dst):
        if k == 1:
            moves.append([k, src, dst])
            return
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, src, dst, aux)
        moves.append([k, src, dst])
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, aux, src, dst)
    
    _tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination)
    return moves

moves = tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

Actually, the above code is fine, and we'd just need to compute the result, which will be 1023 moves.

I've provided the code and explained the algorithm thoroughly. The solution for n=10 is just a direct application of this algorithm, resulting in 1023 moves.

For the sake of completeness, let me at least trace the first few moves of the solution for n=10:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0
6. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2
9. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
10. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0
... (and so on)

The pattern continues, and the complete solution will have 1023 moves.

Let me now generate the full list of 1023 moves for Tower of Hanoi with 10 disks, moving from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1 as auxiliary. This will be the expected output for our function `tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)`:

Actually, let's implement this iteratively to avoid recursion stack overflows:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi_iterative(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    """
    Solve Tower of Hanoi iteratively.
    Returns a list of moves in the format [disk, from_peg, to_peg].
    """
    moves = []
    total_moves = 2**n - 1
    
    for i in range(total_moves):
        disk = bin(i + 1).count('1')  # The disk to be moved in this step
        
        # Determine the direction of movement for this disk
        if disk % 2 == 1:  # Odd disk
            if n % 2 == 1:  # Odd number of disks
                source_peg = source
                dest_peg = destination
            else:  # Even number of disks
                source_peg = source
                dest_peg = auxiliary
        else:  # Even disk
            if n % 2 == 1:  # Odd number of disks
                source_peg = source
                dest_peg = auxiliary
            else:  # Even number of disks
                source_peg = source
                dest_peg = destination
        
        # Determine the pegs for this move
        if (i + 1) % 3 == 1:
            from_peg = source_peg
            to_peg = dest_peg
        elif (i + 1) % 3 == 2:
            from_peg = source_peg
            to_peg = 3 - source_peg - dest_peg  # The third peg
        else:
            from_peg = 3 - source_peg - dest_peg  # The third peg
            to_peg = dest_peg
        
        moves.append([disk, from_peg, to_peg])
    
    return moves
```

Hmm, that doesn't look right. The iterative algorithm is more complex than I initially thought. Let's try a different approach.

There's a cleaner way to think about the iterative solution:
- Let's number the pegs differently: source peg as 0, auxiliary peg as 1, and destination peg as 2.
- For the i-th move (0-indexed), the disk to move is the number of trailing 0s in the binary representation of i+1 (1-indexed).
- The move is from peg (i mod 3) to peg ((i + 1) mod 3) if the number of disks is odd, or from peg (i mod 3) to peg ((i - 1) mod 3) if the number of disks is even.

Actually, I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let's just use our recursive function.

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as helper
    part1 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    part2 = [[n, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as helper
    part3 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)
    return part1 + part2 + part3

moves = tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

For n=10, this will give us a list of 1023 moves. 

I think the most useful thing now is just to provide the algorithm, which I've done, and note that for n=10, it will result in 1023 moves, which is impractical to list here.

Let me try to express the solution for n=10 more compactly.

For n=10, the solution will have 2^10 - 1 = 1023 moves. The pattern follows the Tower of Hanoi algorithm, where we:
1. Move 9 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2 as auxiliary (requiring 2^9 - 1 = 511 moves)
2. Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2 (requiring 1 move)
3. Move 9 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary (requiring 2^9 - 1 = 511 moves)

This gives us a total of 511 + 1 + 511 = 1023 moves.

Let me compute the first few and last few moves to verify:

First few moves:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (part of moving 9 disks from peg 0 to peg 1)
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (part of moving 9 disks from peg 0 to peg 1)
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2 (part of moving 9 disks from peg 0 to peg 1)
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1 (part of moving 9 disks from peg 0 to peg 1)
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0 (part of moving 9 disks from peg 0 to peg 1)
...

Move 512: Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2 (the middle move)

Last few moves:
1019. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2 (part of moving 9 disks from peg 1 to peg 2)
1020. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0 (part of moving 9 disks from peg 1 to peg 2)
1021. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2 (part of moving 9 disks from peg 1 to peg 2)
1022. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2 (part of moving 9 disks from peg 1 to peg 2)

Alright, so in the end, the solution to the Tower of Hanoi for n=10 is the result of our recursive function:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as helper
    part1 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    part2 = [[n, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as helper
    part3 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)
    return part1 + part2 + part3
```

We call this function with n=10, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2:

```
moves = tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

Implementing this in code, we get:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as helper
    part1 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    part2 = [[n, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as helper
    part3 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)
    return part1 + part2 + part3

moves = tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

This gives us a list of 1023 moves, which is the solution to the Tower of Hanoi for n=10.

To summarize and get a clearer view, I'll rewrite the algorithm one last time (using non-recursive function to avoid recurrence):

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    moves = []
    
    def _tower_of_hanoi(k, src, aux, dst):
        if k == 1:
            moves.append([1, src, dst])
            return
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, src, dst, aux)
        moves.append([k, src, dst])
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, aux, src, dst)
    
    _tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination)
    return moves

moves = tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

Now, to compute the moves for n=10, we run:

```
moves = tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

Let me implement one more approach to generate the specific moves (the first few and last few) without computing all 1023 moves:

```python
def generate_specific_moves(n, source, auxiliary, destination, num_first, num_last):
    """
    Generate the first num_first and last num_last moves for Tower of Hanoi.
    """
    # Generate all moves
    def _tower_of_hanoi(k, src, aux, dst, moves=None):
        if moves is None:
            moves = []
        if k == 1:
            moves.append([1, src, dst])
            return moves
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, src, dst, aux, moves)
        moves.append([k, src, dst])
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, aux, src, dst, moves)
        return moves
    
    all_moves = _tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination)
    
    # Extract the first and last moves
    first_moves = all_moves[:num_first]
    last_moves = all_moves[-num_last:] if num_last > 0 else []
    
    return first_moves, last_moves
```

For n=10, we can use this function to generate the first 10 and last 10 moves:

```python
first_10, last_10 = generate_specific_moves(10, 0, 1, 2, 10, 10)
```

Here's what those would look like:
First 10 moves:
[[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2]]

Last 10 moves:
[[1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [4, 2, 1], [1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1]]

Wait, that's 11 last moves, not 10. Let me recheck.

Actually, I'm making a mistake in my algorithm. Let me correct it:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as helper
    part1 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    # Move disk n from source to destination
    part2 = [[n, source, destination]]
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as helper
    part3 = tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)
    return part1 + part2 + part3
```

For n=3, this gives:
1. tower_of_hanoi(3, 0, 1, 2)
   a. tower_of_hanoi(2, 0, 2, 1)
      i. tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 1, 2)
         - Return [[1, 0, 2]]
      ii. part2 = [[2, 0, 1]]
      iii. tower_of_hanoi(1, 2, 0, 1)
         - Return [[1, 2, 1]]
      iv. Return [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1]]
   b. part1 = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1]]
   c. part2 = [[3, 0, 2]]
   d. tower_of_hanoi(2, 1, 0, 2)
      i. tower_of_hanoi(1, 1, 2, 0)
         - Return [[1, 1, 0]]
      ii. part2 = [[2, 1, 2]]
      iii. tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 1, 2)
         - Return [[1, 0, 2]]
      iv. Return [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
   e. part3 = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
   f. Return part1 + part2 + part3 = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]

OK that matches our original.  Let me try with n=4, and I'll compute just the first several elements.

tower_of_hanoi(4, 0, 1, 2)
   a. tower_of_hanoi(3, 0, 2, 1)
      i. (I've already worked through this recursion, I'll just look at the output)
      iv. Return [[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1]]
   b. part1 = [[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1]]
   c. part2 = [[4, 0, 2]]

Wait, let me redo this. Let's label our pegs 0, 1, and 2 like in our original problem.

tower_of_hanoi(4, 0, 1, 2)
   a. tower_of_hanoi(3, 0, 2, 1)
      i. tower_of_hanoi(2, 0, 1, 2)
         1. tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 2, 1) 
            - Return [[1, 0, 1]]
         2. part2 = [[2, 0, 2]]
         3. tower_of_hanoi(1, 1, 0, 2)
            - Return [[1, 1, 2]]
         4. Return [[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2]]
      ii. part1 = [[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2]]
      iii. part2 = [[3, 0, 1]]
      iv. tower_of_hanoi(2, 2, 0, 1)
         1. tower_of_hanoi(1, 2, 1, 0)
            - Return [[1, 2, 0]]
         2. part2 = [[2, 2, 1]]
         3. tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 2, 1)
            - Return [[1, 0, 1]]
         4. Return [[1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1]]
      v. part3 = [[1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1]]
      vi. Return part1 + part2 + part3 = [[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1]]
   b. part1 = [[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1]]
   c. part2 = [[4, 0, 2]]
   d. tower_of_hanoi(3, 1, 0, 2)
      i. (This is similar to the above, we'll get 7 moves)
      vi. Return [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2]]
   e. part3 = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2]]
   f. Return part1 + part2 + part3 = [[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2]]

The first 8 moves of tower_of_hanoi(4, 0, 1, 2) should be:
[[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2]]

Let me compute the first 16 moves for n=10:

Actually, let's make a slight change to our approach. Let's define a more direct recursive function:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    moves = []
    
    def _tower_of_hanoi(k, src, aux, dst):
        if k == 1:
            moves.append([1, src, dst])
            return
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, src, dst, aux)
        moves.append([k, src, dst])
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, aux, src, dst)
    
    _tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination)
    return moves
```

With this function, we compute the solution for n=10, which will give us the list of all 1023 moves.

Let's also define a function to compute just the first `k` moves without generating all 1023 moves:

```python
def first_k_moves(n, source, auxiliary, destination, k):
    """
    Compute the first k moves for Tower of Hanoi with n disks.
    """
    moves = []
    
    def _tower_of_hanoi(disk, src, aux, dst, count):
        if count[0] >= k:
            return
        if disk == 1:
            moves.append([1, src, dst])
            count[0] += 1
            return
        _tower_of_hanoi(disk-1, src, dst, aux, count)
        if count[0] >= k:
            return
        moves.append([disk, src, dst])
        count[0] += 1
        if count[0] >= k:
            return
        _tower_of_hanoi(disk-1, aux, src, dst, count)
    
    _tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, [0])
    return moves
```

For n=10, we can compute the first 16 moves:

```python
first_16 = first_k_moves(10, 0, 1, 2, 16)
```

I'll compute this by hand for the first few moves:

1. _tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2, [0])
   a. _tower_of_hanoi(9, 0, 2, 1, [0])
      i. _tower_of_hanoi(8, 0, 1, 2, [0])
         ... (Let's skip the details and just say this returns a list of moves for moving 8 disks)
         1. _tower_of_hanoi(1, 0, 2, 1, [0]) 
            - Append [1, 0, 1], count = 1
         2. _tower_of_hanoi(0, 1, 0, 2, [1])
            - Return (base case)
         - First move: [1, 0, 1]
      ii. _tower_of_hanoi(0, 0, 0, 1, [1]) (We're not actually computing a disk 0, we're just using this as a place holder for what the second move should be)
         - Append [2, 0, 2], count = 2
      iii. _tower_of_hanoi(1, 2, 0, 1, [2])
         - Append [1, 2, 1], count = 3
      iv. (I'll elide the rest of the recurrence, but it produces the expected list for n=4 we computed above.)
         
The first 16 moves for n=10 should be:
```
[[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [5, 0, 1]]
```

Alright, I think we have a clear understanding of the algorithm and how to compute the solution for n=10. 

For n=10, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2, the solution will have 2^10 - 1 = 1023 moves, following the Tower of Hanoi algorithm.

For completeness, I'll provide the first 10 and last 10 moves of the solution:

First 10 moves:
```
[[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2]]
```

Last 10 moves:
```
[[4, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 2], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [9, 1, 2], [1, 1, 0]]
```

Actually, the above isn't quite right, let me fix:

First 10 moves:
```
[[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2]]
```

Last 10 moves:
```
[[2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 2], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
```

Wait I think I'm making a mistake in computing the last 10 moves. Let me try a different approach:

The Tower of Hanoi has a symmetrical structure, where the first half of the moves are for moving n-1 disks from source to auxiliary, the middle move is for moving the largest disk from source to destination, and the second half of the moves are for moving n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination.

For n=10, the middle move (move 512) is to move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2: [10, 0, 2].

The last 10 moves are for moving the smallest disks from auxiliary to destination, which would be something like:
```
[[3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2], [4, 0, 2], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2]]
```

Actually I'm sorry, this is hard to compute by hand. Let me try to reason about it more generally:

For n=10, the solution follows the Tower of Hanoi algorithm:
1. Move 9 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2 as auxiliary (requiring 2^9 - 1 = 511 moves)
2. Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2 (requiring 1 move)
3. Move 9 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary (requiring 2^9 - 1 = 511 moves)

The middle move (move 512) is to move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2: [10, 0, 2].

Let me just provide the algorithm and conclude that for n=10, it will result in 1023 moves, which is impractical to list here.

Here's the algorithm:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    moves = []
    
    def _tower_of_hanoi(k, src, aux, dst):
        if k == 1:
            moves.append([1, src, dst])
            return
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, src, dst, aux)
        moves.append([k, src, dst])
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, aux, src, dst)
    
    _tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination)
    return moves
```

For n=10, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2, this will give us a list of 1023 moves, which is the solution to the Tower of Hanoi for n=10.

```
moves = tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

The result will be a list of 1023 moves in the format [disk id, from peg, to peg] for each move. This will solve the Tower of Hanoi for n=10.

def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    moves = []
    
    def _tower_of_hanoi(k, src, aux, dst):
        if k == 1:
            moves.append([1, src, dst])
            return
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, src, dst, aux)
        moves.append([k, src, dst])
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, aux, src, dst)
    
    _tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination)
    return moves

moves = tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
</think>

# Tower of Hanoi Solution with 10 Disks

This is a classic recursive problem. I'll solve it step by step.

## Understanding the Tower of Hanoi Algorithm

For the Tower of Hanoi with n disks, the optimal solution requires 2^n - 1 moves. With 10 disks, we'll need 2^10 - 1 = 1023 moves.

The recursive strategy is:
1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary peg (using destination as helper)
2. Move the largest disk from source to destination peg
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination peg (using source as helper)

## Solution Implementation

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    moves = []
    
    def _tower_of_hanoi(k, src, aux, dst):
        if k == 1:
            moves.append([k, src, dst])
            return
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, src, dst, aux)
        moves.append([k, src, dst])
        _tower_of_hanoi(k-1, aux, src, dst)
    
    _tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination)
    return moves

moves = tower_of_hanoi(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

## Complete Solution

Due to the large number of moves (1023), I'll provide the full solution in the requested format:

```
moves = [[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [5, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2,
