Okay, so I need to figure out the sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 14 disks. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Tower of Hanoi. The classic solution involves recursion, where you move the top n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the largest disk to the target peg, and then move the n-1 disks onto the largest one. But with 14 disks, the number of moves is huge—2^14 - 1, which is 16383 moves. Obviously, I can't list all of them here, but maybe there's a pattern or an iterative approach that can be described.

Looking at the search results, the Wikipedia article mentions an iterative solution. It says that for an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Since 14 is even, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move in a particular direction each time. The iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. The key is to alternate moves between the smallest and the next available non-smallest disk, following the rules.

The iterative approach steps mentioned are: move the smallest disk to the next position (right if even, left if odd). For 14 disks, which is even, the initial direction for the smallest disk should be to the right. So each time you move the smallest disk, it goes to the next peg in the right direction (peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0, etc.). Then, the next move is the only legal move possible with the non-smallest disk.

Wait, the Wikipedia entry also says that the iterative solution can be broken down into repeating three steps: moving between A and B, A and C, then B and C. But since our pegs are 0, 1, 2, maybe we need to adjust that. Let me think. The solution for even n ends up on peg C (which is peg 2 in our case), so that's consistent with the goal here.

Another point from the search results: the minimum number of moves is 2^n - 1. For 14 disks, that's 16383 moves. The example given for 3 disks has 7 moves, which matches 2^3 -1. So the solution must follow that pattern.

The chessandpoker.com source mentions an algorithm for odd and even numbers of disks. For even disks, the first move is to the right (peg 1), then following specific steps. The iterative approach from there alternates moving the smallest disk and then making the only possible legal move with another disk.

But how to translate this into a sequence of moves? Since it's a massive number of steps, perhaps the solution can be generated using a loop structure. However, the user is asking for the complete list of moves. That's impractical to write out manually, but maybe there's a pattern or a way to represent it algorithmically.

Wait, the user provided an example for 3 disks. Let me look at that again. The moves for 3 disks are:

moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]

Breaking this down, the steps follow the recursive approach: move disks 1 and 2 to peg 1, then disk 3 to peg 2, then disks 1 and 2 onto peg 2. But for 14 disks, the pattern would be similar but scaled up.

But generating the exact list for 14 disks would require following the iterative method step by step. Since doing this manually is impossible, perhaps the answer should outline the algorithm and state that the moves follow the iterative pattern, but given the user's example, they might expect the actual list. However, with 14 disks, that's 16383 moves, which is impossible to list here. Wait, maybe the user is expecting a general solution or the algorithm, not the explicit list. But the query says "Find the sequence of moves," so perhaps they want the algorithm to generate it.

Alternatively, maybe the answer should provide the recursive approach to generate the moves. The recursive function would be: move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary, move the nth disk to target, then move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target. But implementing this recursively for 14 disks would generate the correct sequence.

However, the search results mention that the iterative solution is more efficient and follows a specific pattern. The iterative approach for even n (like 14) involves moving the smallest disk in a cycle (0→1→2→0...) and then making the only legal move with the other disks.

Given that, the exact sequence can be generated by following these steps:

1. Initialize the direction for the smallest disk (right since n is even).
2. For each move:
   a. If it's an odd-numbered move, move the smallest disk in the current direction.
   b. If it's even-numbered, make the only legal move possible that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

But how to translate this into a list of moves with disk numbers, from, and to pegs?

Each move involves a specific disk. The challenge is tracking which disk is being moved each time. The smallest disk (1) is moved every other move, starting with move 1. The other moves involve the next available disk that can be moved legally.

But tracking this for 14 disks would require simulating each step. Since that's not feasible manually, perhaps the answer should describe the algorithm and note that the sequence follows the iterative method, resulting in 16383 moves. However, the user's example for 3 disks provides an explicit list, so maybe there's a way to represent the pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution can be represented as a recursive breakdown. For example, to move 14 disks from peg 0 to peg 2:

1. Move 13 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2 as auxiliary.
2. Move disk 14 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move 13 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary.

Each of these steps would recursively break down into smaller moves. But again, listing all 16383 moves isn't practical. However, the user's example for 3 disks shows the explicit list, so maybe the answer should provide a way to generate the moves programmatically, perhaps via code.

Looking at the search results, the Wikipedia page mentions the iterative solution steps. The chessandpoker.com source describes an algorithm where for even disks, the first move is to the right (peg 1), then following specific steps. The key is alternating between moving the smallest disk and the next possible disk.

Given that, the exact sequence can be generated by following the iterative algorithm, which for 14 disks would involve moving the smallest disk in a rightward direction each time, and the other moves being determined by the legal options.

But since the user is asking for the complete list of moves, and it's impossible to write all 16383 here, perhaps the answer should explain the algorithm and provide a code snippet that generates the moves, along with the first few and last few moves as an example.

Alternatively, the answer could state that due to the exponential number of moves, it's not feasible to list them all, but provide the recursive or iterative method to generate them. However, the user's example includes a full list for 3 disks, so maybe they expect a similar approach for 14, but that's impractical.

Wait, the user's query might be a trick question, expecting the minimal number of moves (16383) but not the actual sequence. But the example shows the sequence, so perhaps the answer should explain that the sequence follows the iterative method and provide the algorithm, then state that the total number of moves is 2^14 -1 = 16383, and perhaps show the first few moves as an example.

Alternatively, maybe the answer should provide the code to generate the moves. The search result [4] from cs.utexas.edu mentions recursion, so a recursive algorithm could be used. Here's how a recursive approach would work in code:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, target]]
    else:
        moves = hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        moves += hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)
        return moves

Then calling hanoi(14, 0, 2, 1) would generate the list. But the problem is that the disk numbers in the example are 1,2,3,...,14, and the moves would be in the order of moving smaller disks first. However, the example given in the query for 3 disks uses a different order. Wait, in the example, the first move is disk 1 from 0 to 2, then disk 2 from 0 to 1, etc. Let's see:

For 3 disks, the recursive approach would generate:

Move 1 from 0 to 2

Move 2 from 0 to 1

Move 1 from 2 to 1

Move 3 from 0 to 2

Move 1 from 1 to 0

Move 2 from 1 to 2

Move 1 from 0 to 2

Which matches the example's moves. So the recursive approach generates the correct sequence. Therefore, the code above would produce the correct list of moves for 14 disks. However, the user might not want the code but the actual list. But given the size, it's impossible. So the answer should explain that the minimal number of moves is 16383, and provide the recursive or iterative method to generate them, perhaps including a code snippet.

But the user's query specifically says to include the complete list of moves in the specified format. Since that's impossible, maybe the answer should clarify that due to the extremely large number of moves (16,383), it's impractical to list them all here, but provide the method to generate them, such as the recursive algorithm, and confirm that following that algorithm will produce the correct sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer can provide the first few and last few moves as an example, showing the pattern. For instance, the first move is disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (since 14 is even, the first move is to the right), then the next legal move with the next disk, and so on.

Wait, according to the chessandpoker.com source, for even disks, the first move is to the right (peg 1). So for 14 disks, the first move is disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1. Then the next move is the only legal move with another disk, which would be disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2. Then move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2. Then move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1. Then disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0, disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1, disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on. This pattern continues, with the smallest disk moving right each time, and the other moves following the legal options.

But to generate the entire list, one would need to simulate this step-by-step. Since it's a massive list, the answer should probably explain the algorithm and perhaps provide a code example that can generate the moves when executed.

In conclusion, the correct approach is to use the iterative method for even-numbered disks, moving the smallest disk in a rightward direction each time and making the only legal move with the other disks. The total number of moves is 2^14 - 1 = 16383. The exact sequence can be generated using a recursive or iterative algorithm, as described in the search results.

To solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 14 disks, the optimal solution requires 16,383 moves, following the minimum formula \(2^{14} - 1\)[2]. The iterative algorithm for even-numbered disks involves alternating moves between the smallest disk and the only legal non-smallest disk move. Here's the sequence pattern:

1. **Smallest disk (1)**: Moves cyclically right (peg 0 → 1 → 2 → 0...) due to the even disk count[2][5].
2. **Non-smallest disks**: Follow the Tower of Hanoi rules, ensuring no larger disk is placed atop a smaller one.

For example, the first few moves are:
```
moves = [
  [1, 0, 1],  # Smallest disk moves right
  [2, 0, 2],  # Only legal non-smallest move
  [1, 1, 2],  # Smallest disk continues right
  [3, 0, 1],  # Next legal non-smallest move
  [1, 2, 0],  # Smallest disk wraps around
  [2, 2, 1],  # Non-smallest move
  [1, 0, 1],  # Smallest disk continues right
  ...
]
```
The full sequence repeats this pattern, with the smallest disk moving 8,192 times and larger disks following parity-based rules[2][5]. A recursive implementation in Python generates the exact moves:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, target]]
    moves = hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
    moves.append([n, source, target])
    moves += hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)
    return moves

moves = hanoi(14, 0, 2, 1)
```

This produces the complete list of 16,383 moves, adhering to the rules and achieving the goal configuration.
