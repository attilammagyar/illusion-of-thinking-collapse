### Understanding the Problem

The problem presented is the classic **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle, but with 12 disks instead of the usual smaller numbers (like 3 or 4). The rules are:

1. **Three Pegs**: Peg 0 (initial stack), Peg 1 (auxiliary), and Peg 2 (destination).
2. **Disks**: 12 disks of different sizes, numbered from 1 (smallest) to 12 (largest), initially all stacked on Peg 0 in descending order of size (largest at the bottom).
3. **Objective**: Move the entire stack from Peg 0 to Peg 2, following the rules:
   - Only one disk can be moved at a time.
   - Only the top disk of a stack can be moved.
   - A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

### Recursive Approach to Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi problem is a classic example used to teach recursion. The recursive solution can be summarized as follows:

To move `n` disks from Peg `A` to Peg `C` using Peg `B` as auxiliary:

1. Move `n-1` disks from Peg `A` to Peg `B` using Peg `C` as auxiliary.
2. Move the `n-th` disk (the largest one) from Peg `A` to Peg `C`.
3. Move the `n-1` disks from Peg `B` to Peg `C` using Peg `A` as auxiliary.

This approach reduces the problem of moving `n` disks to moving `n-1` disks, and so on, until we reach the base case of moving a single disk.

### Calculating the Number of Moves

For `n` disks, the minimum number of moves required is `2^n - 1`. For `n = 12`:

Number of moves = 2^12 - 1 = 4096 - 1 = 4095 moves.

This means the sequence of moves will be quite lengthy (4095 moves), but we can generate it systematically using the recursive approach.

### Generating the Move Sequence

Given the size (12 disks), writing out all 4095 moves manually is impractical. Instead, we can implement the recursive algorithm to generate the sequence programmatically. However, since we're doing this manually here, I'll outline the approach and provide the beginning and some key parts of the sequence.

#### Recursive Function Definition

Let's define a function `hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary)` that generates the moves to move `n` disks from `source` peg to `target` peg using `auxiliary` peg.

- `n`: number of disks to move.
- `source`: peg from which to move the disks.
- `target`: peg to which to move the disks.
- `auxiliary`: the remaining peg used for intermediate steps.

The function would work as follows:

1. If `n == 1`:
   - Move disk `1` from `source` to `target`.
2. Else:
   - `hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)`
   - Move disk `n` from `source` to `target`.
   - `hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)`

#### Initial Parameters

For our problem:
- `n = 12`
- `source = 0` (Peg 0)
- `target = 2` (Peg 2)
- `auxiliary = 1` (Peg 1)

So, the initial call is `hanoi(12, 0, 2, 1)`.

#### Beginning of the Move Sequence

Let's start generating the moves step by step for the first few moves to see the pattern.

1. `hanoi(12, 0, 2, 1)`:
   - `hanoi(11, 0, 1, 2)`
     - `hanoi(10, 0, 2, 1)`
       - ...
       - This will continue until we reach `hanoi(1, 0, 2, 1)`, which is:
         - Move disk 1 from 0 to 2.
   - Then move disk 12 from 0 to 2.
   - Then `hanoi(11, 1, 2, 0)`.

Given the depth, let's see the first few actual moves:

- The first move is moving disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
- Then disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.
- Then disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.
- Then disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.
- Then disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.
- Then disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.
- Then disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
- And so on...

This pattern continues, where each odd-numbered move involves moving the smallest disk (disk 1), and it alternates between pegs in a specific pattern based on the total number of disks.

#### Complete Move Sequence for 3 Disks (for Verification)

Before proceeding with 12 disks, let's verify with a smaller number, say 3 disks, to ensure our approach is correct.

Initial state: [[3, 2, 1], [], []]

Moves:
1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [[3, 2], [], [1]]
2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1: [[3], [2], [1]]
3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1: [[3], [2, 1], []]
4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2: [[], [2, 1], [3]]
5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0: [[1], [2], [3]]
6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2: [[1], [], [3, 2]]
7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [[], [], [3, 2, 1]]

This matches the example given, confirming our approach is correct.

#### Implementing for 12 Disks

Given the recursive nature, the sequence for 12 disks will follow the same pattern but with many more steps. Here's how the sequence starts and some key points:

1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2
8. Move disk 4 from 0 to 1
9. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1
10. Move disk 2 from 2 to 0
11. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0
12. Move disk 3 from 2 to 1
13. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2
14. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1
15. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1
16. Move disk 5 from 0 to 2
...

This pattern continues, where every `(2^(k-1))`-th move involves moving disk `k` for the first time. For example:
- Disk 1 moves every alternate move.
- Disk 2 moves every 4 moves.
- Disk 3 moves every 8 moves.
- ...
- Disk 12 moves once, at move 2048 (which is 2^(12-1)).

### Final Move Sequence (Partial)

Given the impracticality of listing all 4095 moves here, I'll outline the structure and provide the beginning and some critical moves:

1. `[1, 0, 2]`
2. `[2, 0, 1]`
3. `[1, 2, 1]`
4. `[3, 0, 2]`
5. `[1, 1, 0]`
6. `[2, 1, 2]`
7. `[1, 0, 2]`
8. `[4, 0, 1]`
9. `[1, 2, 1]`
10. `[2, 2, 0]`
11. `[1, 1, 0]`
12. `[3, 2, 1]`
13. `[1, 0, 2]`
14. `[2, 0, 1]`
15. `[1, 2, 1]`
16. `[5, 0, 2]`
...
2048. `[12, 0, 2]` (This is the move where the largest disk is moved to the target peg)
...
4095. `[1, 0, 2]` (Final move completing the stack on Peg 2)

### Verifying the Middle Move

At move 2048, disk 12 is moved from peg 0 to peg 2. This is the halfway point in terms of the total moves (since 2^12 - 1 = 4095, and 2048 is approximately halfway).

Before this move:
- Disks 1 through 11 are all on peg 1 (auxiliary peg).
- Peg 0 has only disk 12.
- Peg 2 is empty.

After moving disk 12 to peg 2, the remaining 2047 moves will involve moving disks 1 through 11 from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary.

### Conclusion

The complete sequence of moves for 12 disks in the Tower of Hanoi puzzle consists of 4095 moves following the recursive pattern described. The sequence starts by moving smaller disks to free up the larger ones, eventually moving the largest disk (disk 12) at the halfway point, and then stacking the remaining disks on top of it.

Given the length, here's the beginning and the critical middle and end moves:

**Beginning:**
```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [5, 0, 2],
    ...
]
```

**Middle (Move 2048):**
```
    [12, 0, 2],
    ...
```

**End:**
```
    ...,
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2]
]
```

For the exact full sequence, one would typically write a recursive algorithm or iterative program to generate all 4095 moves accurately. However, the pattern is consistent and follows the recursive strategy outlined above.
