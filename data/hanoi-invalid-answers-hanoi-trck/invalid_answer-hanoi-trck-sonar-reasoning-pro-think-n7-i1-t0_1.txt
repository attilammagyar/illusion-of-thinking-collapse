Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any explanation, just the raw data in the specified format. First, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi solution follows a recursive pattern. For n disks, the minimum number of moves is 2^n - 1. For 7 disks, that's 127 moves. 

The standard recursive approach is: move n-1 disks from the source to the auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the target peg, and finally move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary to the target. But since the user wants an iterative solution, maybe the iterative approach mentioned in the search results is better. The iterative method alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only valid move with a larger disk.

Looking at the search results, the Wikipedia article mentions an iterative solution where you alternate moves between the smallest piece and a non-smallest piece. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in one direction, and for odd, the other. Since 7 is odd, the smallest disk (1) should move in a specific pattern. The example with 3 disks took 7 moves, which aligns with 2^3 -1.

The user provided an example for 3 disks, which might help in extrapolating the pattern. Each move of the smallest disk alternates direction. For 7 disks, the sequence would be much longer. The challenge is to generate all 127 moves correctly, ensuring each move follows the rules and correctly updates the peg states.

I need to simulate each move step-by-step. Let's start by initializing the pegs: peg0 has [7,6,5,4,3,2,1], peg1 and peg2 are empty. The goal is to move all to peg2.

The iterative approach steps are:
1. Move the smallest disk (1) in the correct direction. Since 7 is odd, the direction might be different. Wait, the search result [3] says for an odd number of disks, the smallest moves to the left. But the example with 3 disks (odd) started by moving disk1 to peg2. Hmm, maybe the direction depends on the initial configuration. Let me check the iterative solution details.

From [3]: "If the number of disks is even, move between pegs A and B; if odd, between A and C." Wait, the initial move for 3 disks (odd) was to peg2. So for 7 disks (odd), the smallest disk should move between A and C (pegs 0 and 2). But the direction alternates each time. Wait, the iterative solution says to move the smallest disk in the same direction each time, but if that's not possible, wrap around. So for odd n, the direction is left (from peg0 to peg2, then peg2 to peg1, then peg1 to peg0, etc.? Or maybe it's a cycle: 0→2→1→0...).

Alternatively, the iterative solution from [3] says: alternate moves between the smallest and non-smallest. The smallest moves in a direction (right if even, left if odd). For 7 disks (odd), the smallest moves left. So the first move is disk1 from peg0 to peg2. Then the next non-smallest move is the only legal move, which would be moving disk2 from peg0 to peg1. Then disk1 from peg2 to peg1. Then disk3 from peg0 to peg2, and so on.

But generating all 127 moves manually is error-prone. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to generate the moves algorithmically. Alternatively, refer to the example provided in the search results. For instance, the 7-disk solution in [1] and [4] might show the sequence. However, the search results don't provide the exact move list, just the method.

Another approach is to use the recursive method but translate it into an iterative list. The recursive solution for n disks involves moving n-1 disks from source to auxiliary, then moving the nth disk, then moving n-1 disks from auxiliary to target. Translating this into moves would require breaking down each step. For 7 disks, this would involve a lot of nested steps.

Alternatively, the iterative approach can be implemented by noting that each move of the smallest disk alternates direction. For odd n, the smallest disk moves in a cycle: 0→2→1→0→2→1... etc. Each time the smallest disk is moved, the next move is the only possible move with the remaining disks.

Let me try to outline the first few moves for 7 disks:

1. Move disk1 from peg0 to peg2. Now peg0: [7,6,5,4,3,2], peg2: [1].
2. Move the smallest possible non-1 disk. The next move is disk2 from peg0 to peg1.
3. Move disk1 from peg2 to peg1. Now peg1: [2,1].
4. Move disk3 from peg0 to peg2.
5. Move disk1 from peg1 to peg0.
6. Move disk2 from peg1 to peg2.
7. Move disk1 from peg0 to peg2. Now peg2: [3,2,1].
8. Move disk4 from peg0 to peg1.
9. Move disk1 from peg2 to peg1.
10. Move disk2 from peg2 to peg0.
11. Move disk1 from peg1 to peg0.
12. Move disk3 from peg2 to peg1.
13. Move disk1 from peg0 to peg2.
14. Move disk2 from peg0 to peg1.
15. Move disk1 from peg2 to peg1. Now peg1: [4,3,2,1].
16. Move disk5 from peg0 to peg2.
... and this continues until all disks are moved.

This pattern continues, with each even-numbered disk moving once, followed by moving the smaller disks back and forth. However, manually listing all 127 steps is tedious. But the user insists on the complete list, so I need to generate it accurately.

Alternatively, I can use the binary representation method. Each disk's moves correspond to binary counting. For each move, the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the move number's binary representation. For example, move 1 (binary 1) has 0 trailing zeros, so move disk1. Move 2 (10) has 1 trailing zero, move disk2. Move 3 (11) has 0, move disk1 again, etc. The direction for each disk is determined by whether the disk number is even or odd. For disk1 (odd), it moves right (0→2→1→0...). For disk2 (even), it moves left (0→1→2→0...). Wait, but the direction might depend on the total number of disks. Since 7 is odd, maybe the direction is adjusted.

This method might help generate the moves systematically. Let's test it:

Move 1: binary 1 (1) → trailing zeros 0 → disk1. Direction for disk1 (odd n=7): 0→2. So move disk1 from 0→2.
Move 2: binary 10 (2) → trailing zeros 1 → disk2. Direction for disk2 (even): 0→1. Move disk2 from 0→1.
Move 3: binary 11 (3) → trailing zeros 0 → disk1. Move disk1 from 2→1.
Move 4: binary 100 (4) → trailing zeros 2 → disk3. Direction for disk3 (odd): 0→2. Move disk3 from 0→2.
Move 5: binary 101 (5) → trailing zeros 0 → disk1. Move disk1 from 1→0.
Move 6: binary 110 (6) → trailing zeros 1 → disk2. Move disk2 from 1→2.
Move 7: binary 111 (7) → trailing zeros 0 → disk1. Move disk1 from 0→2.
Move 8: binary 1000 (8) → trailing zeros 3 → disk4. Direction for disk4 (even): 0→1. Move disk4 from 0→1.
... and so on until all disks are moved.

This seems to align with the iterative approach. Using this method, each disk's movement direction alternates based on its parity. For 7 disks (odd), the direction for each disk is determined by whether the disk number is even or odd. Disk1 (odd) moves in a cycle 0→2→1→0..., disk2 (even) moves 0→1→2→0..., disk3 (odd) moves 0→2→1..., etc.

By following this pattern, we can generate all 127 moves. Each move is determined by the move number, and the disk to move is found by counting trailing zeros in binary. The direction is determined by the disk's parity. This method ensures that each move is valid and follows the rules.

Now, applying this to generate all 127 moves. Each move's from_peg and to_peg can be determined based on the current position of the disk and its direction. For example, disk1 starts at peg0. Its first move is to peg2. Next time, it moves from peg2 to peg1, then peg1 to peg0, and so on.

However, tracking the position of each disk after each move is crucial. For each disk, we need to know its current peg to determine the next move. This requires maintaining a data structure that tracks each disk's location.

Let's outline the steps to generate the moves:

1. Initialize each disk's position: all disks start on peg0.
2. For each move from 1 to 127:
   a. Determine the disk to move: count trailing zeros in the move number's binary representation, add 1.
   b. Determine the direction for that disk (based on its number's parity and total disks).
   c. Find the current peg of the disk.
   d. Determine the next peg based on the direction.
   e. Ensure the move is valid (not placing on a smaller disk).
   f. Update the disk's position and record the move.

This process requires careful tracking. Let's attempt to simulate this for the first few moves:

Move 1:
- Binary: 1 (trailing zeros: 0) → disk1.
- Disk1 is on peg0.
- Direction for disk1 (odd): 0→2.
- Move disk1 from 0→2. Now peg2 has [1].

Move 2:
- Binary: 10 (trailing zeros: 1) → disk2.
- Disk2 is on peg0.
- Direction for disk2 (even): 0→1.
- Move disk2 from 0→1. Now peg1 has [2].

Move 3:
- Binary: 11 (trailing zeros: 0) → disk1.
- Disk1 is on peg2.
- Next direction for disk1: 2→1 (since after 0→2, next is 2→1).
- Move disk1 from 2→1. Now peg1 has [2,1].

Move 4:
- Binary: 100 (trailing zeros: 2) → disk3.
- Disk3 is on peg0.
- Direction for disk3 (odd): 0→2.
- Move disk3 from 0→2. Now peg2 has [3].

Move 5:
- Binary: 101 (trailing zeros: 0) → disk1.
- Disk1 is on peg1.
- Next direction: 1→0 (since after 2→1, next is 1→0).
- Move disk1 from 1→0. Now peg0 has [7,6,5,4,3,2,1] → wait, no. Wait, after move 4, peg0 has [7,6,5,4], peg1 has [2,1], peg2 has [3]. So moving disk1 from peg1 to peg0: peg0 now has [7,6,5,4,1], but that's invalid because 1 is on top of 4. Wait, no, disks are stacked with larger at the bottom. So peg0 after move 4 has [7,6,5,4,3,2] (since disk3 was moved to peg2). Wait, initial setup was peg0:7,6,5,4,3,2,1. After move1: peg0:7,6,5,4,3,2; peg2:1. Move2: peg0:7,6,5,4,3; peg1:2. Move3: peg1:2,1. Move4: peg0:7,6,5,4; peg2:3. So move5: disk1 is on peg1. Moving disk1 from peg1 to peg0. But peg0 has 7,6,5,4. So placing 1 on peg0 is allowed (since 1 < 4 is not true; wait, 1 is smaller than 4, so it's allowed. Wait, the rule is that a larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller one. So 1 can be placed on 4 because 1 < 4. So peg0 becomes [7,6,5,4,1]. Wait, but disks are stacked from bottom to top as larger to smaller. So after move4, peg0 has [7,6,5,4], peg1 has [2,1], peg2 has [3]. Moving disk1 from peg1 to peg0: peg0 now has [7,6,5,4,1], peg1 has [2], peg2 has [3]. That's valid.

Move5: disk1 from peg1 to peg0. Now peg0:7,6,5,4,1; peg1:2; peg2:3.

Move6:
- Binary: 110 (trailing zeros:1) → disk2.
- Disk2 is on peg1 (since move2 moved it there, and it hasn't moved since).
- Direction for disk2 (even): previous move was to peg1. Next move for even disks is peg1→peg2.
- Move disk2 from peg1 to peg2. Check if valid: peg2 has [3], which is larger than 2. So valid. Now peg2 has [3,2].

Move6: disk2 from peg1 to peg2. Peg1 becomes empty, peg2:3,2.

Move7:
- Binary: 111 (trailing zeros:0) → disk1.
- Disk1 is on peg0.
- Next direction: 0→2 (since disk1's direction is 0→2→1→0...). Last move was to peg0, so next is 0→2.
- Move disk1 from peg0 to peg2. But peg2 has [3,2], and 1 < 2, so valid. Now peg2:3,2,1.

Move7: disk1 from peg0 to peg2. Peg0:7,6,5,4; peg2:3,2,1.

Move8:
- Binary: 1000 (trailing zeros:3) → disk4.
- Disk4 is on peg0.
- Direction for disk4 (even): 0→1.
- Move disk4 from peg0 to peg1. Now peg1 has [4], peg0:7,6,5.

Move8: disk4 from 0→1. Peg1:4.

Move9:
- Binary: 1001 (trailing zeros:0) → disk1.
- Disk1 is on peg2 (after move7).
- Next direction: 2→1 (since last move for disk1 was 0→2 in move7, next is 2→1).
- Move disk1 from peg2 to peg1. Check peg1 has [4], which is larger than 1. Valid. Peg1:4,1.

Move9: disk1 from 2→1. Peg1:4,1.

Move10:
- Binary: 1010 (trailing zeros:1) → disk2.
- Disk2 is on peg2 (after move6).
- Direction for disk2 (even): previous move was to peg2 (move6), next is peg2→0 (since even direction is 0→1→2→0...). Wait, even disks move in a cycle 0→1→2→0. So disk2 was moved to peg2 in move6. Next move for disk2 would be peg2→0. But peg0 has [7,6,5], which is larger than 2. So move disk2 from peg2 to peg0. Now peg0:7,6,5,2.

Move10: disk2 from 2→0. Peg0:7,6,5,2; peg2:3.

Move11:
- Binary: 1011 (trailing zeros:0) → disk1.
- Disk1 is on peg1 (after move9).
- Next direction: 1→0 (since disk1's last move was to peg1 in move9, next is 1→0).
- Move disk1 from peg1 to peg0. Check peg0 has [7,6,5,2], which is larger than 1. Valid. Peg0:7,6,5,2,1.

Move11: disk1 from 1→0. Peg0:7,6,5,2,1.

Move12:
- Binary: 1100 (trailing zeros:2) → disk3.
- Disk3 is on peg2 (after move4).
- Direction for disk3 (odd): 0→2→1→0... Wait, disk3 was moved to peg2 in move4. For odd disks, the direction is 0→2→1→0. So next move after peg2 is peg2→1.
- Move disk3 from peg2 to peg1. Check peg1 has [4,1], top is 1. 3 >1, so valid. Peg1:4,3,1.

Move12: disk3 from 2→1. Peg1:4,3,1.

Move13:
- Binary: 1101 (trailing zeros:0) → disk1.
- Disk1 is on peg0 (after move11).
- Next direction: 0→2 (since last move was to peg0 in move11, next is 0→2).
- Move disk1 from peg0 to peg2. Peg2 has [3] (after move10, disk2 was moved to peg0). Wait, after move10, peg2 has [3] (since disk3 was moved to peg1 in move12). So peg2 is empty except for disk3? Wait, move12 moved disk3 from peg2 to peg1. So peg2 after move12 has nothing. Wait, no: move4 moved disk3 to peg2. Then move7 moved disk1 to peg2. Then move10 moved disk2 to peg0. Then move12 moved disk3 from peg2 to peg1. So after move12, peg2 is empty. So moving disk1 from peg0 to peg2 is allowed. Peg0:7,6,5,2,1 → after moving disk1, peg0:7,6,5,2; peg2:1.

Move13: disk1 from 0→2. Peg2:1.

Move14:
- Binary: 1110 (trailing zeros:1) → disk2.
- Disk2 is on peg0 (after move10).
- Direction for disk2 (even): 0→1→2→0. Last move was to peg0 in move10. Next move is peg0→1.
- Move disk2 from peg0 to peg1. Check peg1 has [4,3,1]. Top is 1. 2 >1, so valid. Peg1:4,3,1,2.

Move14: disk2 from 0→1. Peg1:4,3,1,2.

Move15:
- Binary: 1111 (trailing zeros:0) → disk1.
- Disk1 is on peg2 (after move13).
- Next direction: 2→1 (since last move was to peg2 in move13, next is 2→1).
- Move disk1 from peg2 to peg1. Peg1 has [4,3,1,2]. Top is 2. 1 <2, valid. Peg1:4,3,1,2,1. Wait, but disks can't have duplicates. Wait, no, each disk is unique. Wait, disk1 is the smallest, so moving it on top of peg1 which has disk2 is allowed. So peg1 becomes [4,3,1,2,1] → no, that's incorrect because each disk is unique. Wait, no, in the Tower of Hanoi, each disk is a distinct size. So peg1 after move14 has [4,3,1,2]. Then moving disk1 (size 1) on top of peg1's top disk (size 2) is allowed. So peg1 becomes [4,3,1,2,1] → but that's impossible because each disk is unique. Wait, no, the disks are numbered 1 to 7, with 1 being the smallest. So each peg's state is a stack of disks, each larger than the one above. So in move14, peg1 has disks 4,3,1,2. Wait, that's invalid because 2 is placed on top of 1, which is smaller. That's a problem. Wait, this indicates an error in the move sequence.

Wait, this suggests that the previous moves have an invalid state. Let's retrace:

After move12: peg1 has [4,3,1] (disk4 at bottom, then disk3, then disk1). Then move13 moves disk1 from peg0 to peg2. Peg0 after move11 was [7,6,5,2,1], so after move13, peg0 is [7,6,5,2]. Peg2 now has [1]. Move14 is moving disk2 from peg0 (which has [7,6,5,2]) to peg1. Peg1 currently has [4,3,1]. Placing disk2 on top of peg1's top disk (1) is allowed because 2 >1. So peg1 becomes [4,3,1,2]. Then move15 moves disk1 from peg2 to peg1. Peg1's top is 2, so placing 1 on top is valid. Peg1 becomes [4,3,1,2,1]. Wait, but disk1 is already in peg1's stack at position 3 (counting from bottom). Wait, no, in move12, peg1 had [4,3,1]. Then move14 adds disk2 on top of 1, making [4,3,1,2]. Then move15 adds disk1 on top of 2, making [4,3,1,2,1]. But this is invalid because disk1 cannot be placed on top of disk2 (since 1 <2 is allowed). Wait, no, the rule is that you cannot place a larger disk on a smaller one. Placing a smaller disk on a larger one is allowed. So [4,3,1,2,1] is valid because each disk is smaller than the one below it. Wait, no: 4 >3 >1 <2 <1. That's not correct. Because 1 is placed on 2, which is allowed, but then 2 is below 1, which is invalid. Wait, no. The stack should be in decreasing order. So after move14, peg1 has [4,3,1,2]. This is invalid because 1 is below 2, which is smaller. This indicates an error in the move sequence.

This suggests that the previous moves have an inconsistency. The problem arises in move14 when moving disk2 to peg1, which already has [4,3,1]. Placing disk2 on top of 1 is invalid because 2 >1. Wait, no, the rule is that you cannot place a larger disk on a smaller one. So moving disk2 (size 2) onto peg1's top disk (size 1) is invalid because 2 >1. Therefore, move14 is invalid, which means the earlier reasoning is flawed.

This indicates a mistake in the move generation logic. The error occurred because the non-smallest move (move14) wasn't properly validated. The iterative approach requires that after moving the smallest disk, the next move is the only legal move with the remaining disks. However, in this case, moving disk2 to peg1 is invalid, so there must be another legal move.

This highlights the complexity of generating the moves manually. To avoid such errors, it's better to rely on a systematic method or an algorithm that ensures each move is valid. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to generate the moves using the recursive method, which inherently ensures validity.

The recursive solution for moving n disks from source to target using auxiliary:

1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.
2. Move nth disk from source to target.
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target.

For 7 disks, this would involve:

- Move 6 disks from peg0 to peg1 using peg2.
- Move disk7 from peg0 to peg2.
- Move 6 disks from peg1 to peg2 using peg0.

Each of these steps breaks down into smaller recursive steps. Translating this into an explicit list of moves would require expanding each recursive call.

However, generating 127 moves manually is impractical. Instead, I can use the fact that the recursive approach's move sequence can be represented as a specific pattern. Each time a disk is moved, it alternates between the source and target pegs based on the recursion depth.

Alternatively, referring back to the search results, the example for 3 disks in the user's query shows the move sequence. Extrapolating that pattern to 7 disks would involve repeating the process for each disk size.

Given the complexity and the potential for errors in manual generation, the correct approach is to output the complete move list following the iterative method, ensuring each move is valid. However, without an automated way to generate each move, I'll have to rely on the known optimal solution for 7 disks, which should have 127 moves, and structure the output accordingly.

The final answer must strictly follow the specified format, with each move's peg states correctly updated. Given the constraints, I'll proceed to list all 127 moves, ensuring that each move adheres to the rules and corrects any previous errors by redefining move_ids when necessary.
