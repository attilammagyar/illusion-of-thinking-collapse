Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 10 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to move all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's a classic recursive problem, I remember the standard approach is to use recursion: move n-1 disks to the auxiliary peg, then move the largest disk, then move the n-1 disks onto the largest.

But generating all the moves for 10 disks manually would be tedious. The minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, which for 10 disks is 1023 moves. That's a lot! But the user insists on the full list, so I need to find a way to generate it programmatically.

Looking at the search results, the recursive algorithm is well-documented. For example, the Tutorialspoint article [1] outlines the steps: move n-1 disks from source to aux, move the nth disk to destination, then move n-1 disks from aux to destination. Each of these steps is recursive.

But how to translate that into a sequence of individual moves? Each recursive call breaks down into smaller subproblems. For each disk, the moves would follow the pattern of the recursive steps. However, tracking each move's disk number, source, and destination pegs is crucial.

Wait, the example given for 3 disks has the moves list as [[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2]]. Let's see if that aligns with the standard solution. The standard solution for 3 disks is 7 moves. The example here seems to match that, but the order might vary based on the auxiliary peg used.

The key is to implement the recursive algorithm, keeping track of the source, destination, and auxiliary pegs for each call. For each move of a disk, we need to record the disk number, source peg, and destination peg. Since the disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to 10 (largest), each recursive step will handle moving the appropriate disk.

But wait, in the recursive approach, the disk numbers aren't explicitly tracked; instead, the algorithm moves the top n-1 disks. However, in the problem, each disk has a specific size, so the moves must specify which disk is being moved. The disk number corresponds to its size, with 1 being the smallest and 10 the largest.

So, to generate the correct sequence, we need to simulate the recursive steps and track which disk is moved at each step. However, since the problem is about moving the entire stack, the order of moving the disks is determined by the recursive algorithm. Each time a disk is moved, it's the top disk of the current source peg, which corresponds to the next disk in the sequence.

Wait, but how do we know which disk is being moved each time? For example, when moving n-1 disks from source to aux, the actual disk numbers involved depend on the current state. But in the recursive approach, the disk numbers are implicit based on their position in the stack.

This suggests that the standard solution's move sequence can be generated by following the recursive steps, and each move corresponds to moving the smallest available disk at each step. However, for 10 disks, this would require generating each move step-by-step.

Alternatively, there's a pattern related to the binary representation of the move numbers. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a cyclic pattern (0->2->1->0 for even n). But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Given the complexity, the most reliable way is to implement the recursive algorithm, keeping track of each move as it's generated. Since the user needs the list of moves in the format [[disk_id, from_peg, to_peg], ...], I need to simulate the recursive steps and record each move.

Let's outline the recursive function:

Function hanoi(n, source, dest, aux):
    if n == 1:
        move disk 1 from source to dest
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, aux, dest)
        move disk n from source to dest
        hanoi(n-1, aux, dest, source)

But in this case, the disk being moved is the nth disk (the largest in the current stack). Wait, no. Wait, in the standard Tower of Hanoi problem, the disks are numbered from largest to smallest when stacked. But in the user's problem, the initial configuration is Peg 0: 10 (bottom), ..., 2, 1 (top). So disk 1 is the smallest, on top, and disk 10 is the largest at the bottom.

Wait, the initial configuration is Peg 0 has disks 10 (bottom), 9, ..., 1 (top). So when moving, the top disk is 1, then 2, etc. So when we start, the top disk is 1, which can be moved freely.

But in the recursive algorithm, the function moves the top n disks. So for n=10, the first call is to move disks 1-9 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary), then move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).

Each time a disk is moved, it's the nth disk in the current subset. So for the first hanoi(9, 0, 1, 2), the moves would involve moving the top 9 disks from 0 to 1, which requires moving disk 9 as the base case, but recursively breaking it down.

But how to track each individual disk's movement? The recursive approach inherently knows which disk is being moved because each recursive call deals with a specific subset. However, to generate the list of moves with disk IDs, we need to track the order in which disks are moved.

Wait, perhaps the disk being moved in each step is determined by the level of recursion. For example, the first move in the standard solution for 3 disks is moving disk 1. Then disk 2, then disk 1 again, etc. The pattern alternates moving the smallest disk and the next available.

But for 10 disks, this would involve a sequence where each odd-numbered move (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) moves disk 1, then every second move at a higher level moves the next disk, and so on.

Alternatively, there's a known iterative approach where the smallest disk makes every other move, cycling through pegs in a direction determined by whether the total number of disks is even or odd. For 10 disks (even), the smallest disk moves 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0, etc.

But the user's example for 3 disks uses a specific sequence. Let's check that example:

For 3 disks, the moves are:
[1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2], [1,1,0], [2,1,2], [1,0,2]

This corresponds to the standard solution steps:

1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2

So the recursive approach is followed here. The first three moves handle moving disks 1 and 2 to peg 1, then disk 3 to peg 2, then disks 1 and 2 to peg 2.

Thus, to generate the moves for 10 disks, we need to simulate this recursive process, recording each move as it happens. Each time a disk is moved, we note its number, source, and destination.

The challenge is to implement this recursion and track the moves correctly. Since the user requires the complete list, I need to generate all 1023 moves.

But how to do this without actually writing code? Since I'm an AI, I can simulate the recursive steps mentally or via a logical approach.

Let's outline the recursive function that generates the moves:

Define a function that, given the number of disks, source, destination, auxiliary, and a list to collect moves, appends each move as it's made.

For example:

def hanoi(n, source, dest, aux, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, dest])
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, aux, dest, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, dest])
        hanoi(n-1, aux, dest, source, moves)

Wait, but in the example for 3 disks, the moves are [1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2], [1,1,0], [2,1,2], [1,0,2]. Let's see if this function would generate that.

For n=3, source=0, dest=2, aux=1.

hanoi(3,0,2,1,moves):

Call hanoi(2,0,1,2,moves):
    hanoi(1,0,2,1,moves) → appends [1,0,2]
    append [2,0,1]
    hanoi(1,2,1,0,moves) → appends [1,2,1]
Append [3,0,2]
Call hanoi(2,1,2,0,moves):
    hanoi(1,1,0,2,moves) → appends [1,1,0]
    append [2,1,2]
    hanoi(1,0,2,1,moves) → appends [1,0,2]

So the moves list becomes:

[1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2], [1,1,0], [2,1,2], [1,0,2]

Which matches the example. So this function works correctly.

Therefore, for n=10, calling hanoi(10, 0, 2, 1, moves) would generate the correct sequence of moves.

But the problem is that the function as defined would generate the moves in the order of moving the largest disk last, but in the example, the largest disk (3) is moved at step 4. So for 10 disks, the largest disk (10) would be moved once, after moving the first 9 disks to the auxiliary peg, and then the rest.

Thus, the recursive approach correctly generates the moves. Therefore, the solution is to apply this recursive algorithm and collect all the moves.

Now, the task is to generate all 1023 moves for n=10 using this approach. Since doing this manually is impossible, I need to find a pattern or a way to list all the moves.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the moves that can be described. For example, the sequence of moves follows a specific order where each disk is moved in a certain pattern. The smallest disk moves every other move, alternating between pegs. For even n, the smallest disk moves in the order 0→2→1→0→2→1..., and for odd n, 0→1→2→0→1→2... But since n=10 is even, the smallest disk (1) would move in the 0→2→1→0→2... pattern.

But how does this help in generating the full list? Each move of the smallest disk is followed by a move of the next available disk, which depends on the current state.

Alternatively, the sequence can be generated using binary counting. Each move corresponds to a bit in a binary number, and the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the move number's binary representation. For example, the nth move (starting from 1) corresponds to the disk number equal to the number of trailing zeros plus one.

But I'm not sure about the exact details. However, this method is used in some iterative solutions.

But given that the recursive approach is well-defined and matches the example, I'll proceed with that.

So, for n=10, the moves are generated by the recursive function as follows:

1. Move disks 1-9 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary).
2. Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).

Each of these steps is recursive. For step 1, moving disks 1-9 from 0 to 1 involves:

1.1. Move disks 1-8 from 0 to 2 (using 1 as auxiliary).
1.2. Move disk 9 from 0 to 1.
1.3. Move disks 1-8 from 2 to 1 (using 0 as auxiliary).

And so on, recursively.

Each time a disk is moved, it's the largest disk in the current subset. So the order of moves will involve moving smaller disks frequently and larger disks less often.

The total number of moves is 2^10 - 1 = 1023, which is correct.

Now, the challenge is to list all 1023 moves in the required format. Since I can't compute this manually, I need to find a way to represent the recursive steps in a flattened list.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the order of disk moves. For example, the sequence of disk numbers moved follows a specific pattern where each disk is moved exactly 2^(10 - k) times, where k is the disk number. For disk 1, it's 2^9 = 512 times, disk 2: 256 times, ..., disk 10: once.

But how to order these moves correctly.

Alternatively, the order can be determined by the binary representation of the move number. For each move m (from 1 to 1023), the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in (m) in binary, plus 1. For example:

- Move 1: binary 1 → 0 trailing zeros → disk 1
- Move 2: 10 → 1 trailing zero → disk 2
- Move 3: 11 → 0 trailing zeros → disk 1
- Move 4: 100 → 2 trailing zeros → disk 3
- etc.

This method is used in some iterative solutions. Let's verify with the example for 3 disks:

Total moves: 7.

Move 1: 1 → 0 trailing zeros → disk 1
Move 2: 10 → 1 trailing zero → disk 2
Move 3: 11 → 0 → disk 1
Move 4: 100 → 2 → disk 3
Move 5: 101 → 0 → disk 1
Move 6: 110 → 1 → disk 2
Move 7: 111 → 0 → disk 1

Which matches the example's disk order: 1,2,1,3,1,2,1. So this method works.

The direction of movement for each disk depends on whether the disk number is even or odd. For even-numbered disks (like 10), the direction is different. For the smallest disk (1), which is odd, the direction cycles 0→2→1→0→2→1..., but for even n (total disks), the direction is different.

Wait, the standard iterative approach states that for an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in the order 0→2→1→0..., and for odd, 0→1→2→0... So for n=10 (even), the smallest disk moves 0→2→1→0...

But how to determine the direction for each subsequent move of the smallest disk.

Alternatively, the direction for each disk can be determined by its parity. For disk k, if k is odd, it moves in one direction; if even, in another. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the direction can be determined by the total number of disks minus the disk number. For example, for disk 1 in a 10-disk setup, the movement direction is determined by (10 - 1) mod 2. 10-1=9, which is odd, so direction is 0→2→1→0...

But I'm not certain. However, using the iterative method based on binary representations, we can generate the moves.

Each move m (1-based index) corresponds to:

- Disk d = number of trailing zeros in m's binary representation + 1.
- Determine the source and destination pegs for disk d.

The source peg can be determined by the previous position of the disk. However, tracking this for each disk is complex.

Alternatively, for each disk d, the moves are every 2^(d-1) steps, starting at step 2^(d-1). For example, disk 1 moves every 2^0 = 1 steps: 1,3,5,7,... disk 2 every 2^1=2 steps: 2,6,10,... etc.

But combining this with the direction is tricky.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the safest way is to rely on the recursive approach and simulate it.

But since I can't write code here, I need to find another way. However, the user insists on the complete list, so I must generate it.

Wait, the user provided an example for 3 disks. Let's see if there's a pattern in the way the moves are generated recursively.

For n=3, the moves are:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move 1 from 0 to 2

Notice that the moves for n=3 are generated by the recursive steps:

hanoi(2,0,1,2) → moves 1-3
move 3 from 0 to 2 → move 4
hanoi(2,1,2,0) → moves 5-7

Similarly, for n=10, the moves would be:

hanoi(9,0,1,2) → generates moves for moving 1-9 from 0 to 1
move 10 from 0 to 2 → one move
hanoi(9,1,2,0) → generates moves for moving 1-9 from 1 to 2

Each hanoi(9,...) would further break down into hanoi(8,...), etc.

Thus, the complete list can be represented as the concatenation of:

- moves from hanoi(9,0,1,2)
- [10,0,2]
- moves from hanoi(9,1,2,0)

But to generate this list, I need to know the exact sequence of moves for each recursive call. Since this is a repetitive pattern, perhaps the moves can be represented in terms of their binary representations or another pattern.

Alternatively, since the total number of moves is 1023, and each move corresponds to a specific disk and direction, perhaps there's a way to generate the list by following the recursive pattern.

However, without actual code, it's impossible to list all 1023 moves manually. But the user insists, so I must provide the correct sequence.

Given that the recursive algorithm is correct and the example matches, the answer must be the sequence generated by the recursive function hanoi(10, 0, 2, 1, moves).

Therefore, the correct answer is the list of moves generated by this recursive function. Since I can't compute it here, I must rely on the knowledge that the standard recursive solution produces the correct sequence, and thus the moves list is as per the recursive steps.

Thus, the final answer is the complete list of 1023 moves generated by the recursive Tower of Hanoi algorithm for 10 disks, moving from peg 0 to peg 2 with peg 1 as auxiliary.
