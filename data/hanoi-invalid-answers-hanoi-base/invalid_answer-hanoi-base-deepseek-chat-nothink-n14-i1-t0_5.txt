### Understanding the Problem

The problem presented is the classic **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle, but with a larger number of disks (14 in this case). The objective is to move all the disks from the first peg (Peg 0) to the third peg (Peg 2), following the three fundamental rules:

1. **Single Disk Move**: Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. **Top Disk Only**: You can only move the disk that is on top of a stack.
3. **No Larger on Smaller**: A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

### Recursive Approach to Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi problem is well-studied and has a recursive solution. The recursive strategy can be summarized as follows for moving `n` disks from a source peg to a target peg using an auxiliary peg:

1. Move `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg, using the target peg as a temporary holding area.
2. Move the `n-th` disk (the largest one) from the source peg directly to the target peg.
3. Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg, using the source peg as a temporary holding area.

This approach ensures that at no point is a larger disk placed on top of a smaller one, and it systematically reduces the problem size until it reaches the base case of moving a single disk.

### Applying the Recursive Solution to 14 Disks

Given that we have 14 disks on Peg 0, and we want to move them all to Peg 2, using Peg 1 as the auxiliary peg, we can outline the steps as follows:

1. Move the top 13 disks from Peg 0 to Peg 1 (using Peg 2 as auxiliary).
2. Move the 14th disk (the largest) from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
3. Move the 13 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (using Peg 0 as auxiliary).

Each of these steps involving 13 disks can be further broken down recursively until we're moving single disks.

### Generating the Move Sequence

To generate the complete sequence of moves for 14 disks, we can implement the recursive algorithm. However, manually listing all moves for 14 disks would be impractical due to the sheer number of moves (2^14 - 1 = 16,383 moves). Instead, I'll outline the general approach and provide the beginning and ending segments of the move sequence to illustrate the pattern.

#### General Move Generation

Here's how the recursive function would work in pseudocode:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        return [[n, source, target]]
    else:
        moves = hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        moves += hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)
        return moves
```

For `n = 14`, `source = 0`, `target = 2`, `auxiliary = 1`, this function would generate all 16,383 moves.

#### Beginning of the Move Sequence

Let's look at the first few moves to see the pattern:

1. Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
2. Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.
3. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.
4. Move disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
5. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.
7. Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
8. Move disk 4 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.
   ...

This pattern continues, where each odd-numbered move involves moving disk 1, and higher disks are moved in a sequence that builds upon the smaller subproblems.

#### Middle and End of the Move Sequence

After many such recursive steps, the sequence would approach moving the largest disk (disk 14):

- Move disk 14 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.

Then, the remaining 13 disks are moved from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 0 as auxiliary, following a similar pattern.

### Final Move Sequence (Abbreviated)

Given the impracticality of listing all 16,383 moves here, I'll provide the structure and some key moves:

1. First, move disks 1-13 from Peg 0 to Peg 1 (using Peg 2 as auxiliary). This takes 2^13 - 1 = 8191 moves.
2. Then, move disk 14 from Peg 0 to Peg 2 (1 move).
3. Finally, move disks 1-13 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (using Peg 0 as auxiliary). This takes another 8191 moves.

Total moves: 8191 + 1 + 8191 = 16,383.

### Complete Move Sequence (First and Last Few Moves)

Here are the first few and last few moves to illustrate:

**First few moves:**
```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [5, 0, 2],
    ...
]
```

**Last few moves (after moving disk 14):**
```
    ...
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2]
]
```

### Verifying the Number of Moves

The minimum number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi with `n` disks is `2^n - 1`. For `n = 14`:

`2^14 - 1 = 16,384 - 1 = 16,383 moves`

This confirms that our approach is correct in terms of the number of moves required.

### Conclusion

While it's not feasible to list all 16,383 moves here due to space constraints, the sequence can be systematically generated using the recursive algorithm described. Each move adheres to the rules, ensuring that no larger disk is ever placed on top of a smaller one, and only one disk is moved at a time.

If you'd like, I can provide a script or program that generates the complete sequence of moves for you to execute or verify. Would you be interested in that?
