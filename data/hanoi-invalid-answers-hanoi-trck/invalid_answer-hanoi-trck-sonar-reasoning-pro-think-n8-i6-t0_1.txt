Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 8 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation, just the raw data in the specified format. Hmm, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi has a recursive solution. For n disks, the minimum number of moves is 2^n - 1. For 8 disks, that's 255 moves. But generating all 255 moves manually would be tedious. Wait, maybe there's a pattern or algorithm that can help generate the moves systematically.

Looking at the search results, result [3] from Wikipedia mentions a binary solution. It talks about using bitwise operations to determine the source and destination pegs for each move. The formulas given are for the from_peg and to_peg based on the move number. Also, the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move number. That sounds promising. Let me try to understand that.

For each move m (starting from 1), the from_peg is calculated as (m & (m - 1)) % 3, and the to_peg is ((m | (m - 1)) + 1) % 3. But wait, the note says that for even n puzzles, the references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed. Since we have 8 disks, which is even, does that mean we need to swap pegs 1 and 2 in the output? Or adjust the formulas accordingly? Hmm, the example in [3] mentions that for even n, the output references to pegs 1 and 2 are reversed. So maybe after calculating the from and to pegs using the formula, if n is even, we swap pegs 1 and 2. Let me confirm.

Alternatively, the formulas might already account for that. Wait, the Wikipedia entry says, "For even n puzzles, the output references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed." So after applying the formulas, if n is even, swap 1 and 2. So for each move, after computing from_peg and to_peg using the formulas, if the disk count is even, we need to swap 1 and 2 in the resulting pegs. Let me test this with a small example.

Take the example given in the user's query with 3 disks. The solution provided has moves like moving from 0 to 2, then 0 to 1, etc. But according to the formulas, for n=3 (odd), the standard formulas apply. Let's see move 1 for n=3. Using the formula for from_peg: (1 & 0) % 3 = 0. To_peg: ((1 | 0) +1) %3 = (1+1)%3=2. So from 0 to 2, which matches the example. For move 2, from_peg: (2 & 1) = 0, to_peg: ((2 |1)+1)%3 = (3+1)%3=1. So from 0 to 1. Which also matches. So the formulas work for odd n. But for even n=8, we need to reverse pegs 1 and 2. So after calculating from_peg and to_peg using the formulas, if the result is 1, change it to 2, and if it's 2, change to 1. Let's test this with n=2. For move 1: from_peg (1 &0)=0, to_peg ((1|0)+1)=2. But since n=2 is even, we swap 1 and 2. Wait, no, the note says for even n, the references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed. So the original formulas give to_peg as 2, but since n is even, we swap 1 and 2, so to_peg becomes 1. Let me check the standard solution for n=2. The moves should be: move 1 from 0 to 1, move 2 from 0 to 2, move 1 from 1 to 2. Let's see. For move 1 (m=1): from_peg=0, to_peg=2. But since n=2 is even, swap 1 and 2, so to_peg becomes 1. So move 1: 0→1. Move 2 (m=2): from_peg=(2 &1)=0, to_peg=((2|1)+1)=3+1=4%3=1. Swap 1 and 2, so to_peg becomes 2. So move 2: 0→2. Move 3 (m=3): from_peg=(3&2)=2, to_peg=((3|2)+1)=3+1=4%3=1. Swap 1 and 2, so to_peg becomes 2. So move 3: 2→2? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the adjustment. Alternatively, perhaps for even n, the target peg is different. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the standard solution for even n alternates the target peg between 1 and 2. Wait, maybe the initial target for even n is peg 1, and for odd n it's peg 2. But I'm getting confused. Let me refer back to the Wikipedia entry. It says, "For even n puzzles, the output references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed." So after computing from and to using the formulas, if n is even, swap 1 and 2 in the resulting pegs. So for each move's from_peg and to_peg, if the value is 1, change to 2, and if it's 2, change to 1. Let's test this with n=2.

For n=2 (even), the solution should be:

Move 1: 0→1

Move 2: 0→2

Move 3: 1→2

But according to the formulas:

For m=1:

from_peg = (1 & 0) %3 =0

to_peg = ((1 |0)+1)%3 = (1+1)%3=2

Since n is even, swap 1 and 2. So to_peg becomes 1. So move 1: 0→1. Correct.

For m=2:

from_peg = (2 &1) =0

to_peg = ((2|1)+1)=3+1=4%3=1

Swap 1 and 2 → to_peg becomes 2. So move 2:0→2. Correct.

For m=3:

from_peg = (3&2)=2

to_peg = ((3|2)+1)=3+1=4%3=1 → swap to 2. So from_peg=2, to_peg=2. Wait, that can't be right. Moving from peg 2 to peg 2 is invalid. Hmm, something's wrong here. Maybe the formulas are different for even n. Let me check the Wikipedia entry again.

Wait, the Wikipedia entry says: "Furthermore, the single disk to be moved for any specific move is determined by the number of times the move count (m) can be divided by 2 (i.e. the number consecutive zero bits at the right of m), and then adding 1. In the example above for move 216, with 3 right hand 0s, disk 4 (3 + 1) is moved from peg 2 to peg 1."

Wait, perhaps the formulas for from and to pegs are adjusted based on whether n is even or odd. The initial formulas are for odd n. For even n, the references to pegs 1 and 2 are reversed. So perhaps the formulas remain the same, but after computing from and to, we swap 1 and 2 in the results.

But in the example for m=3, the from_peg would be (3 & 2) = 2, to_peg ((3|2)+1)=3+1=4%3=1. For even n, swap 1 and 2, so to_peg becomes 2. So from_peg=2, to_peg=2. That's invalid. So there must be a mistake in my understanding.

Alternatively, maybe the formulas are different for even n. Let me check the alternative formulation given in [3]:

Another formulation is:

from_peg = (m - (m & -m)) %3

to_peg = (m + (m & -m)) %3

These hold for odd n puzzles. For even n puzzles, the output references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed.

So for even n, after computing from_peg and to_peg using these formulas, swap 1 and 2.

Let's test this with n=2 (even).

For m=1:

m=1, m&-m=1. So from_peg=(1-1)%3=0. to_peg=(1+1)%3=2. Since n is even, swap 1 and 2. So from_peg remains 0, to_peg becomes 1. So move 1: 0→1. Correct.

For m=2:

m=2, m&-m=2. from_peg=(2-2)%3=0. to_peg=(2+2)%3=4%3=1. Swap 1 and 2 → to_peg=2. So move 2:0→2. Correct.

For m=3:

m=3, m&-m=1. from_peg=(3-1)=2%3=2. to_peg=(3+1)=4%3=1. Swap 1 and 2 → to_peg=2. So move 3:2→2. Wait, that's invalid. Hmm, this suggests a problem. Maybe the formulas are not correct for even n, or perhaps I'm applying the swap incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps the swap is only applied to the to_peg, not the from_peg. Or maybe the entire calculation is different. This is getting complicated. Let's look for another approach.

Alternatively, the recursive solution for Tower of Hanoi is well-known. For n disks, the steps are:

1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary peg.

2. Move the nth disk from source to target.

3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target.

But implementing this recursively would generate the correct sequence of moves. However, for 8 disks, this would require 255 moves, which is a lot to write out manually. But perhaps there's a pattern in the moves that can be captured algorithmically.

Another approach mentioned in the search results is the binary solution. Each move corresponds to a binary count, and the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move number. For example, move 1 (binary 1) has 0 trailing zeros, so disk 1 is moved. Move 2 (10) has 1 trailing zero, so disk 2. Move 3 (11) has 0 trailing zeros, disk 1. Move 4 (100) has 2 trailing zeros, disk 3, etc.

So for each move m, the disk to move is (number of trailing zeros in m) +1. Then, the direction to move the disk depends on whether the disk is even or odd. For even-numbered disks, the direction is clockwise (0→1→2→0), and for odd-numbered disks, it's counterclockwise (0→2→1→0). Wait, but this might vary based on the total number of disks. For even n, the initial direction is different. Let me check.

In some sources, the direction alternates based on the number of disks. For even n, the smallest disk moves in a clockwise direction (0→1→2→0), and for odd n, counterclockwise (0→2→1→0). Each subsequent disk (larger ones) moves in the opposite direction of the previous. Wait, no, each disk's direction is determined by its own parity. For example, disk 1 (smallest) moves in a direction based on the total number of disks. If n is even, disk 1 moves clockwise; if n is odd, counterclockwise. Then, each subsequent disk moves in the opposite direction. But I'm not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, the standard solution involves alternating between moving the smallest disk and another disk. The smallest disk moves in a cyclic pattern, and the other moves are determined by the available peg. But this might be more complex to implement.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the binary method is the way to go. Let's try to implement that.

For each move m from 1 to 255:

1. Determine the disk to move: count the number of trailing zeros in m's binary representation, add 1. Let's call this k.

2. Determine the direction to move the disk. For even k, move in one direction; for odd k, another. Wait, no, the direction depends on the total number of disks. Since we have 8 disks (even), the smallest disk (k=1) moves in a clockwise direction: 0→1→2→0. For each subsequent disk, the direction alternates. Wait, perhaps for even n, the direction for the smallest disk is clockwise, and for each larger disk, the direction is opposite. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the binary method's formulas from Wikipedia can be used, adjusting for even n by swapping pegs 1 and 2 in the to_peg calculation.

Let me try to generate the first few moves for n=8 using the binary method formulas, adjusting for even n.

Using the formulas:

For each move m:

from_peg = (m - (m & -m)) % 3

to_peg = (m + (m & -m)) % 3

But since n=8 is even, swap pegs 1 and 2 in the results.

Wait, the note says for even n puzzles, the output references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed. So after calculating from_peg and to_peg using the formulas, swap any 1 with 2 and vice versa.

Let's test this for m=1:

m=1, binary 00000001. Trailing zeros: 0 → disk 1.

from_peg = (1 - 1) %3 =0

to_peg = (1 +1) %3=2

Since n=8 is even, swap 1 and 2. So to_peg becomes 1. So move 1: 0→1. But according to the standard solution for even n, the first move should be 0→1. Wait, but in the user's example with 3 disks (n=3, odd), the first move is 0→2. So for even n, the first move is 0→1. Let's see.

But according to the binary method formulas, after swapping, the to_peg becomes 1. So move 1: from 0 to 1. Then, for move 2:

m=2, binary 00000010. Trailing zeros:1 → disk 2.

from_peg = (2 -2) %3=0

to_peg = (2+2)%3=4%3=1. Swap 1 and 2 → to_peg=2. So move 2:0→2.

Move 3:

m=3, binary 00000011. Trailing zeros:0 → disk1.

from_peg=(3-1)=2%3=2

to_peg=(3+1)=4%3=1. Swap → to_peg=2. So move3:2→2? That can't be right. Wait, this suggests an error. Maybe the swap is applied differently. Alternatively, perhaps the swap is only applied to the to_peg, not the from_peg. Or maybe the entire calculation is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the formulas are different for even n. Let me check the Wikipedia entry again. It says, "For even n puzzles, the output references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed." So after computing from_peg and to_peg using the formulas, swap 1 and 2 in both from and to pegs.

Wait, for example, if the formula gives from_peg=1, change it to 2, and if it's 2, change to 1. Similarly for to_peg.

Let's re-calculate move 3 with this in mind.

For m=3:

Using the formulas:

from_peg = (3 - (3 & -3)) %3

3 in binary is 11, so 3 & -3 is 1 (since two's complement of 3 is ...11111101, so & gives 1). So from_peg = (3-1)=2%3=2.

to_peg = (3 +1)=4%3=1.

Now, since n=8 is even, swap 1 and 2 in both from and to pegs.

So from_peg=2 becomes 1.

to_peg=1 becomes 2.

So move3: from_peg=1, to_peg=2. So moving from peg1 to peg2. But after move1 and move2, peg1 has disk1, peg2 has disk2. So moving disk1 from peg1 to peg2 is allowed (since disk1 is smaller than disk2). So move3:1→2. That's valid. The state after move3 would be peg0:8,7,6,5,4,3,2; peg1: empty; peg2:2,1. Wait, no. Wait, initial state is peg0:8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1. After move1: peg0:8,7,6,5,4,3,2; peg1:1. Move2: peg0:8,7,6,5,4,3; peg2:2. Move3: move disk1 from peg1 to peg2. So peg2 would have 2,1. That's valid. So yes, move3 is valid.

Continuing, move4:

m=4, binary 100. Trailing zeros:2 → disk3.

from_peg = (4 -4) %3=0.

to_peg=(4+4)=8%3=2. Swap 1 and 2 → to_peg=1. So move4:0→1. But peg0 has 8,7,6,5,4,3. Moving disk3 (which is the top disk on peg0, which is disk3? Wait, no. Wait, the disks are numbered 1 (smallest) to 8 (largest). So peg0 initially has 8 (bottom),7,6,5,4,3,2,1 (top). After move1: peg0 has 8,7,6,5,4,3,2; peg1 has 1. Move2: peg0 has 8,7,6,5,4,3; peg2 has 2. Move3: peg2 has 2,1; peg1 empty. Move4: move disk3 from peg0 to peg1. But the top disk on peg0 is 3. So moving disk3 from peg0 to peg1. That's allowed. So peg1 now has 3. Then move4's state: peg0:8,7,6,5,4; peg1:3; peg2:2,1.

This seems correct. So the binary method with swapping for even n seems to work.

So the plan is:

For each move m from 1 to 255:

1. Calculate the disk to move: number of trailing zeros in m's binary +1.

2. Calculate from_peg and to_peg using the formulas:

   from_peg = (m - (m & -m)) %3

   to_peg = (m + (m & -m)) %3

3. Since n=8 is even, swap 1 and 2 in both from_peg and to_peg.

4. Record the move.

But wait, the formulas give from_peg and to_peg, and then we swap 1 and 2. So for example, if the formula gives from_peg=1, change it to 2; if it's 2, change to 1. Same for to_peg.

Let me implement this step by step for the first few moves to see if it aligns with the expected pattern.

Move 1:

m=1, binary 00000001. Trailing zeros:0 → disk1.

from_peg = (1 -1) %3=0.

to_peg = (1+1)%3=2.

Swap 1 and 2: from_peg remains 0, to_peg becomes1.

So move1:0→1. Disk1 moves from peg0 to peg1.

Move2:

m=2, binary 00000010. Trailing zeros:1 → disk2.

from_peg=(2-2)%3=0.

to_peg=(2+2)%3=4%3=1.

Swap 1 and 2: to_peg becomes2.

Move2:0→2. Disk2 moves from peg0 to peg2.

Move3:

m=3, binary 00000011. Trailing zeros:0 → disk1.

from_peg=(3-1)%3=2.

to_peg=(3+1)%3=1.

Swap 1 and 2: from_peg becomes1, to_peg becomes2.

Move3:1→2. Disk1 moves from peg1 to peg2.

Move4:

m=4, binary 00000100. Trailing zeros:2 → disk3.

from_peg=(4-4)%3=0.

to_peg=(4+4)%3=8%3=2.

Swap 1 and 2: to_peg becomes1.

Move4:0→1. Disk3 moves from peg0 to peg1.

Move5:

m=5, binary 00000101. Trailing zeros:0 → disk1.

from_peg=(5-1)%3=4%3=1.

to_peg=(5+1)%3=6%3=0.

Swap 1 and 2: from_peg becomes2, to_peg remains0.

Move5:2→0. Disk1 moves from peg2 to peg0.

Move6:

m=6, binary 00000110. Trailing zeros:1 → disk2.

from_peg=(6-2)%3=4%3=1.

to_peg=(6+2)%3=8%3=2.

Swap 1 and 2: from_peg becomes2, to_peg becomes1.

Move6:2→1. Disk2 moves from peg2 to peg1.

Move7:

m=7, binary 00000111. Trailing zeros:0 → disk1.

from_peg=(7-1)%3=6%3=0.

to_peg=(7+1)%3=8%3=2.

Swap 1 and 2: to_peg becomes1.

Move7:0→1. Disk1 moves from peg0 to peg1.

Move8:

m=8, binary 00001000. Trailing zeros:3 → disk4.

from_peg=(8-8)%3=0.

to_peg=(8+8)%3=16%3=1.

Swap 1 and 2: to_peg becomes2.

Move8:0→2. Disk4 moves from peg0 to peg2.

This seems to be generating valid moves. Now, the challenge is to generate all 255 moves following this pattern. But doing this manually is impractical. However, since the user insists on the complete list, I need to find a way to generate it programmatically. But since I can't execute code, I'll have to rely on the pattern and formulas to list all moves.

Alternatively, the recursive approach can be used to generate the moves. For 8 disks, the recursive steps would involve moving 7 disks, then the 8th, then 7 again. But again, listing all 255 moves would require following this pattern.

Given the time constraints and the requirement to provide the complete list, I'll proceed to generate the moves using the binary method formulas adjusted for even n=8, as outlined above. Each move's from_peg and to_peg are determined by the formulas, then swapped if necessary, and the disk to move is determined by the trailing zeros in m's binary representation.

Now, to ensure the correctness of each move, I'll need to track the state of each peg after each move. However, manually tracking the state for 255 moves is error-prone. But according to the problem statement, the user wants the list of moves in the specified format, including the peg states after each move. This adds complexity because each move affects the pegs' states, which must be accurately represented.

To handle this, I'll need to simulate each move step-by-step, updating the pegs' states accordingly. Starting with peg0: [8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], peg1: [], peg2: [].

For each move:

1. Determine the disk to move (k) based on trailing zeros in m.

2. Determine from_peg and to_peg using the formulas and swap for even n.

3. Check if the move is valid (i.e., the top disk on from_peg is k, and to_peg's top disk is larger than k or empty).

4. Update the pegs' states accordingly.

But simulating this for 255 moves manually is impossible. Therefore, I must rely on the formulas to generate the moves correctly, assuming that the binary method produces a valid sequence.

Given that the binary method is a known solution for Tower of Hanoi, and the formulas from Wikipedia are correct when adjusted for even n, I can proceed to generate the moves using these formulas.

However, the user also requires the peg states after each move. To generate these, I need to track each peg's disks after each move. This requires maintaining a data structure for each peg, representing the disks from bottom to top. For example, peg0 starts as [8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], meaning 8 is at the bottom and 1 at the top.

Each move involves taking the top disk (smallest number) from the from_peg and placing it on the to_peg, ensuring that it's smaller than the top disk there (or the to_peg is empty).

Given the complexity, I'll proceed to generate the first few moves' states to illustrate the pattern, then outline the rest, but the user insists on the complete list. Since I can't generate all 255 moves here due to length, but the user insists, I must find a way to output them all.

Wait, but the user's note says: "I really do want you to enumerate all the moves. Please do not truncate the list, however long it may be. I do insist. Do not ask for confirmation, just output the complete list of moves please."

This implies that I must output all 255 moves, each with move_id, from_peg, to_peg, and the peg states. Given the token limit, this might not be feasible, but the user insists, so I'll proceed as much as possible.

However, considering the token limit, generating all 255 moves here would exceed the allowed response length. But the user is aware of this and insists, so I'll proceed to generate the moves, even if it's truncated by the system.

But wait, the assistant's output is limited by token count. So perhaps the correct approach is to generate the moves programmatically using the formulas and output them in the required format. Since I can't write code here, I'll have to describe the method and provide a partial list, but the user wants the complete list.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the moves that can be captured in a loop, but again, without writing code, it's challenging.

Given the constraints, I'll proceed to generate the first 15 moves as an example, then indicate that the pattern continues for all 255 moves. However, the user explicitly stated not to truncate, so this approach would fail. Therefore, the only way is to use the binary method formulas to generate each move's details and output them all.

But given the time and space constraints, I'll proceed to generate the moves using the binary method formulas, applying the swap for even n=8, and track the peg states step by step. This will require meticulous calculation for each move.

peg0:8 7 6 5
peg1:1
peg2:4 3 2

Move15:
m=15, trailing zeros=0 →disk1.
from_peg=(15-1)%3=14%3=2 → swap to1
to_peg=(15+1)%3=16%3=1 → swap to2
Move:1→2
peg0:8 7 6 5
peg1:
peg2:4 3 2 1

...

Continuing this pattern up to move 255 would generate all necessary moves. However, manually listing all 255 moves is impractical here. But the user insists, so I must proceed.

Given the constraints, I'll generate the moves programmatically using the formulas and output them in the required format. Since I can't execute code, I'll outline the method and provide the complete list as per the formulas.

The final answer will be a CSV-like list of moves, each with move_id, from_peg, to_peg, and the peg states after each move. Each move is generated using the binary method formulas adjusted for even n=8, ensuring that the moves are valid and follow the Tower of Hanoi rules.
