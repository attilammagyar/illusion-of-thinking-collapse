This is the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 10 disks. Let's work through this systematically.

## Tower of Hanoi - General Solution
For Tower of Hanoi with n disks, the minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1. With 10 disks, we need 2^10 - 1 = 1024 - 1 = 1023 moves.

The general recursive algorithm for solving Tower of Hanoi is:
1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary peg (using destination as auxiliary)
2. Move the largest disk from source to destination
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination (using source as auxiliary)

Let me implement this recursively to get the full list of moves:

```python
def hanoi_moves(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves=None):
    if moves is None:
        moves = []
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, destination])  # Move disk 1 from source to destination
        return moves
    
    hanoi_moves(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)  # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves.append([n, source, destination])  # Move disk n from source to destination
    hanoi_moves(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)  # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    
    return moves

# Get moves for 10 disks
moves = hanoi_moves(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

But wait, I see the expected format is `[disk id, from peg, to peg]` where the disk id is the actual size of the disk (1 for smallest, 10 for largest in this case). Let me adjust my approach:

```python
def hanoi_moves(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves=None):
    if moves is None:
        moves = []
    if n == 0:
        return moves
    
    hanoi_moves(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)  # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves.append([n, source, destination])  # Move disk n from source to destination
    hanoi_moves(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)  # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    
    return moves

# Get moves for 10 disks
moves = hanoi_moves(10, 0, 1, 2)
```

Actually, I think I should work this out step-by-step for clarity. Let's start with a smaller number of disks to see the pattern, then apply it to 10 disks.

### Tower of Hanoi with 3 disks
Initial state: `[[3, 2, 1], [], []]`

Let me trace through the solution:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2: `[[3, 2], [], [1]]`
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1: `[[3], [2], [1]]`
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1: `[[3], [2, 1], []]`
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2: `[[], [2, 1], [3]]`
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0: `[[1], [2], [3]]`
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2: `[[1], [], [3, 2]]`
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2: `[[], [], [3, 2, 1]]`

In terms of moves:
```
moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2],
         [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
```

This matches the expected format from the example. So my approach is correct.

Now I need to generate this solution for 10 disks. I'll implement the recursive algorithm:

```python
def hanoi_solution(n, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2, moves=None):
    if moves is None:
        moves = []
    
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, destination])
        return moves
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    hanoi_solution(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    hanoi_solution(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)
    
    return moves

# Generate solution for 10 disks
moves = hanoi_solution(10)
```

Wait, I made a mistake. The disk IDs should be their actual sizes (1 for smallest, n for largest). Let's correct that:

```python
def hanoi_solution(n, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2, moves=None):
    if moves is None:
        moves = []
    
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, destination])
        return moves
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    hanoi_solution(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    hanoi_solution(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)
    
    return moves
```

Actually, I think this is right. Let me trace through the algorithm to make sure:

For n=3:
1. Call hanoi_solution(3, 0, 1, 2)
   - Call hanoi_solution(2, 0, 2, 1)
     - Call hanoi_solution(1, 0, 1, 2)
       - Add [1, 0, 2] to moves
     - Add [2, 0, 1] to moves
     - Call hanoi_solution(1, 2, 0, 1)
       - Add [1, 2, 1] to moves
   - Add [3, 0, 2] to moves
   - Call hanoi_solution(2, 1, 0, 2)
     - Call hanoi_solution(1, 1, 2, 0)
       - Add [1, 1, 0] to moves
     - Add [2, 1, 2] to moves
     - Call hanoi_solution(1, 0, 1, 2)
       - Add [1, 0, 2] to moves

Final moves:
```
moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2],
         [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
```

Which matches the expected output from the example. So my algorithm is correct. Now I can apply it to n=10:

```python
def hanoi_solution(n, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2, moves=None):
    if moves is None:
        moves = []
    
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, destination])
        return moves
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    hanoi_solution(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    hanoi_solution(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)
    
    return moves

# Generate solution for 10 disks
moves = hanoi_solution(10)
```

For n=10, we expect 2^10 - 1 = 1023 moves. Let me generate all these moves:

Rather than actually calling the function (which would generate a very long list), let me manually show the solution for n=10 by outlining the steps:

1. Move disks 1-9 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)

Now, for step 1 (moving disks 1-9 from peg 0 to peg 1):
1. Move disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2
2. Move disk 9 from peg 0 to peg 1
3. Move disks 1-8 from peg 2 to peg 1

For step 3 (moving disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2):
1. Move disks 1-8 from peg 1 to peg 0
2. Move disk 9 from peg 1 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2

This recursion continues down to the base case of moving a single disk.

Since there are 1023 moves for n=10, I'll implement the function and generate the full list:

```python
def hanoi_solution(n, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2, moves=None):
    if moves is None:
        moves = []
    
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, destination])
        return moves
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    hanoi_solution(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    hanoi_solution(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)
    
    return moves

# Generate solution for 10 disks
moves = hanoi_solution(10)
```

Let me simulate this recursive function for n=10 step by step:

1. Call hanoi_solution(10, 0, 1, 2)
   - Call hanoi_solution(9, 0, 2, 1)
     - Call hanoi_solution(8, 0, 1, 2)
       - ... (recursion continues)
     - Add [9, 0, 1] to moves
     - Call hanoi_solution(8, 2, 0, 1)
       - ... (recursion continues)
   - Add [10, 0, 2] to moves
   - Call hanoi_solution(9, 1, 0, 2)
     - Call hanoi_solution(8, 1, 2, 0)
       - ... (recursion continues)
     - Add [9, 1, 2] to moves
     - Call hanoi_solution(8, 0, 1, 2)
       - ... (recursion continues)

OK, this method works and the recursive function would generate all 1023 moves for n=10. But writing them all out here would be very long. So instead, I'll implement the recursive function and list the first 10 and last 10 moves from the solution:

Let me carefully consider the case of n=10:

First, I should clear up the notation:
- "Disk 1" is the smallest disk.
- "Disk 10" is the largest disk.

The recursive solution:
1. Move disks 1-9 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)

OK instead of writing out all 1023 moves, let me just implement the recursive function and then list the moves for n=10:

```python
def hanoi_solution(n, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    
    moves = []
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary))
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves

# Generate solution for 10 disks
moves = hanoi_solution(10)
```

Alright, instead of actually calling the recursive function, let me trace through it systematically for n=1, n=2, etc., and then generalize to n=10.

For n=1:
moves = [[1, 0, 2]]

For n=2:
moves = hanoi_solution(1, 0, 2, 1) + [[2, 0, 2]] + hanoi_solution(1, 1, 0, 2)
     = [[1, 0, 1]] + [[2, 0, 2]] + [[1, 1, 2]]
     = [[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2]]

For n=3:
moves = hanoi_solution(2, 0, 2, 1) + [[3, 0, 2]] + hanoi_solution(2, 1, 0, 2)
     = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1]] + [[3, 0, 2]] + [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
     = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]

For n=4:
moves = hanoi_solution(3, 0, 2, 1) + [[4, 0, 2]] + hanoi_solution(3, 1, 0, 2)

And so on.

I'll stop here and use a slightly different approach to compute the actual moves for n=10. I'll implement the recursive algorithm and compute the full list of moves.

But actually, let me think about this problem from the perspective of what is the optimal strategy to follow for an arbitrary number of disks.

For odd values of n, optimal strategy can be described as:
- Make the legal move of the smallest disk to the destination peg
- Make the legal move of a disk (not the smallest) to a non-source peg
- Repeat until all disks are on the destination peg

For even values of n, optimal strategy can be described as:
- Make the legal move of the smallest disk to the auxiliary peg
- Make the legal move of a disk (not the smallest) to a non-source peg
- Repeat until all disks are on the destination peg

Let me implement this strategy to generate all the moves for n=10:

```python
def hanoi_iterative(n, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2):
    # For even n, the pattern is different
    if n % 2 == 0:
        auxiliary, destination = destination, auxiliary
    
    moves = []
    total_moves = 2**n - 1
    
    for i in range(1, total_moves + 1):
        if i % 3 == 1:
            # Move the smallest disk
            if n % 2 == 1:
                # For odd n, smallest disk moves between source and destination
                moves.append([1, source if (i // 3) % 2 == 0 else destination, 
                              destination if (i // 3) % 2 == 0 else source])
            else:
                # For even n, smallest disk moves between source and auxiliary
                moves.append([1, source if (i // 3) % 2 == 0 else auxiliary, 
                              auxiliary if (i // 3) % 2 == 0 else source])
        elif i % 3 == 2:
            # Move between source and auxiliary
            # Determine which disk to move
            # (This part is more complex and would need more detailed logic)
            pass
        else:  # i % 3 == 0
            # Move between auxiliary and destination
            # Determine which disk to move
            # (This part is more complex and would need more detailed logic)
            pass
    
    return moves
```

This gets more complex. Let me go back to the recursive approach, which is more straightforward for this problem:

```python
def hanoi_solution(n, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    
    moves = []
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary))
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves
```

OK, I think that's the correct solution for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. For n=10, this function would generate all 1023 moves required to solve the puzzle.

Let me generate the solution for n=10:

```python
moves = hanoi_solution(10)
```

Rather than listing all 1023 moves, let me provide the first 10 and last 10 moves to illustrate the solution:

First 10 moves:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0
6. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2
9. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
10. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0

Last 10 moves:
1014. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
1015. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
1016. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
1017. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1
1018. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0
1019. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1
1020. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
1021. Move disk 9 from peg 0 to peg 2
1022. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
1023. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0

Actually, I made an error above. Let me compute the exact moves for n=10 by explicitly tracing through the recursive function:

Let's do this for a smaller case first, say n=3, to make sure I understand the recursive algorithm correctly:

For n=3:
```
def hanoi_solution(3, 0, 1, 2):
    if 3 == 1:  # False
        return [[1, 0, 2]]
    
    moves = []
    
    # Move 2 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(2, 0, 2, 1))
    
    # For hanoi_solution(2, 0, 2, 1):
    #     if 2 == 1:  # False
    #         return [[1, 0, 1]]
    #     
    #     moves_inner = []
    #     
    #     # Move 1 disk from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary)
    #     moves_inner.extend(hanoi_solution(1, 0, 1, 2))
    #     
    #     # For hanoi_solution(1, 0, 1, 2):
    #     #     return [[1, 0, 2]]
    #     
    #     # So moves_inner becomes [[1, 0, 2]]
    #     
    #     # Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1
    #     moves_inner.append([2, 0, 1])
    #     
    #     # Move 1 disk from peg 2 to peg 1 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)
    #     moves_inner.extend(hanoi_solution(1, 2, 0, 1))
    #     
    #     # For hanoi_solution(1, 2, 0, 1):
    #     #     return [[1, 2, 1]]
    #     
    #     # So moves_inner becomes [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1]]
    #     
    #     return moves_inner
    
    # So moves becomes [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1]]
    
    # Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2
    moves.append([3, 0, 2])
    
    # Move 2 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(2, 1, 0, 2))
    
    # For hanoi_solution(2, 1, 0, 2):
    #     if 2 == 1:  # False
    #         return [[1, 1, 2]]
    #     
    #     moves_inner = []
    #     
    #     # Move 1 disk from peg 1 to peg 0 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
    #     moves_inner.extend(hanoi_solution(1, 1, 2, 0))
    #     
    #     # For hanoi_solution(1, 1, 2, 0):
    #     #     return [[1, 1, 0]]
    #     
    #     # So moves_inner becomes [[1, 1, 0]]
    #     
    #     # Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2
    #     moves_inner.append([2, 1, 2])
    #     
    #     # Move 1 disk from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary)
    #     moves_inner.extend(hanoi_solution(1, 0, 1, 2))
    #     
    #     # For hanoi_solution(1, 0, 1, 2):
    #     #     return [[1, 0, 2]]
    #     
    #     # So moves_inner becomes [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
    #     
    #     return moves_inner
    
    # So moves becomes [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
    
    return moves
```

So for n=3, the moves are:
```
[[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
```

Which matches the expected result. Great!

For n=10, the total number of moves is 2^10 - 1 = 1023, which is a lot to list explicitly. The recursive structure of the solution is:

1. Move disks 1-9 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)

Let me write the full recursive function that would compute all 1023 moves for n=10. I'll then list just the first few and last few moves of the solution to show the pattern:

```python
def hanoi_solution(n, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    
    moves = []
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary))
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves

# Generate solution for 10 disks
moves = hanoi_solution(10)
```

Given the recursive nature of the Tower of Hanoi solution, I can determine the pattern of the first few moves and last few moves for n=10:

First 10 moves:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0
6. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2
9. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
10. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0

Last 10 moves:
1014. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
1015. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
1016. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
1017. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1
1018. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0
1019. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1
1020. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
1021. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2
1022. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
1023. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0

Actually I think I made an error in the last 10 moves. Let me think carefully about the recursive structure again:

For n=10:
1. Move disks 1-9 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)

The key insight is that disk 10 (the largest disk) only moves once, from peg 0 to peg 2. This move happens after all smaller disks are moved to peg 1, which takes 2^9 - 1 = 511 moves. So the 512th move would be moving disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2.

Let's trace through the solution for n=10 using the recursive structure:

First few moves involve moving disk 1 (smallest) according to the recursive pattern.
After 511 moves, all disks 1-9 are on peg 1, and disk 10 is on peg 0.
The 512th move is to move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2.
The remaining moves involve moving disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary.

So, the 512th move (exactly in the middle of the 1023 moves) is:
512. Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2

Let me try to derive the last 10 moves:

For the last phase (moving disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2), we're essentially solving the Tower of Hanoi for n=9, starting from peg 1 and ending at peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary. This requires 2^9 - 1 = 511 moves.

So, after moving disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2 (the 512th move), we need to execute the solution for n=9, which is another 511 moves. The total solution is 1023 moves.

The last 10 moves would be the last 10 moves of the solution for n=9, adjusted for the pegs:

1014. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
1015. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2
1016. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
1017. Move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 0
1018. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
1019. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 0
1020. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
1021. Move disk 4 from peg 1 to peg 2
1022. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
1023. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2

Let's double-check this. For the last 10 moves, we're in the process of moving disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary). We know that disk 10 is already on peg 2 (as that was the 512th move).

Hmm, the last move I gave doesn't look right. Let me re-think the structure of the solution for the last phase.

For moving disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary), the last disk to move would be disk 9, which is the largest of the disks 1-9. This move would happen after all disks 1-8 are moved to peg 0, which takes 2^8 - 1 = 255 moves. Then, disk 9 moves from peg 1 to peg 2, which is the 257th move of this phase (or the 512 + 256 = 768th move overall).

After disk 9 is moved, we need to move disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary), which requires another 255 moves. So, the last 10 moves would be part of this final phase.

For this final phase (moving disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1 as auxiliary), the moves would follow the recursive pattern for n=8.

Let me break down the structure of the last 10 moves more carefully.

After the 768th move (moving disk 9 from peg 1 to peg 2), we have disks 1-8 on peg 0, and disks 9-10 on peg 2. The next 255 moves involve moving disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary).

Since we're looking at the last 10 moves (moves 1014-1023), we're near the end of this final phase. In particular, we're at moves 255 - 10 + 1 = 246 to 255 of the phase of moving disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2.

To figure out what these moves are, I need to understand the pattern of the last 10 moves for n=8.

For n=8, the total number of moves is 2^8 - 1 = 255. The last 10 moves (moves 246-255) would be part of the final phase of moving disks 1-7 from peg 1 to peg 2 (after disk 8 has been moved from peg 0 to peg 2).

This recursion gets complex for the last 10 moves. Let me take a step back and think about this problem from another angle.

Let's try another approach. Instead of trying to derive the exact moves for n=10, I'll implement a function to generate the moves and then extract the first and last 10 moves.

```python
def hanoi_solution(n, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    
    moves = []
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary))
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves

# Generate solution for 10 disks
moves = hanoi_solution(10)

# Print first 10 and last 10 moves
print("First 10 moves:")
for i in range(10):
    print(f"{i+1}. Move disk {moves[i][0]} from peg {moves[i][1]} to peg {moves[i][2]}")

print("\nLast 10 moves:")
for i in range(1013, 1023):
    print(f"{i+1}. Move disk {moves[i][0]} from peg {moves[i][1]} to peg {moves[i][2]}")
```

OK let's derive the solution for n=10 in the required format. The full list would be:

```python
def hanoi_solution(n, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    
    moves = []
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary))
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves

# Generate solution for 10 disks
moves = hanoi_solution(10)
```

Here's a systematic approach to deriving the Tower of Hanoi solution for n=10:

1. Step 1: Move disks 1-9 from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2 as auxiliary. This takes 2^9 - 1 = 511 moves.
2. Step 2: Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2. This is the 512th move.
3. Step 3: Move disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary. This takes another 2^9 - 1 = 511 moves, for a total of 1023 moves.

Using the recursive function I defined earlier, I can generate all 1023 moves for n=10. Here's the full solution:

```
moves = hanoi_solution(10)
```

I'll go through it step by step for n=10:

Since there are 1023 moves, I'm going to calculate them systematically.

For n=10:
1. Move disks 1-9 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)

For the first step, we recursively apply the algorithm for n=9:
1. Move disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 9 from peg 0 to peg 1
3. Move disks 1-8 from peg 2 to peg 1 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)

And we continue this recursion down to n=1.

Let me just implement the function and test it:

```python
def hanoi_solution(n, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    
    moves = []
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary))
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves

# Generate solution for 10 disks
moves = hanoi_solution(10)

# Verify the length
print(len(moves))  # Should be 1023
```

Assuming the length is 1023 as expected, this function correctly generates all the moves for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 10 disks.

Now, I can provide a partial listing to demonstrate the solution:

First 10 moves:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1
5. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0
6. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
8. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2
9. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
10. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0

Move 512 (the middle move):
512. Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2

Last 10 moves:
1014. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
1015. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
1016. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
1017. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1
1018. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0
1019. Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1
1020. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
1021. Move disk 9 from peg 1 to peg 2
1022. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
1023. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2

Let me double-check the last 10 moves by thinking through the recursion:

For n=10:
1. Move disks 1-9 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)

The last 10 moves are part of step 3. For step 3, we recursively apply the algorithm for n=9:
1. Move disks 1-8 from peg 1 to peg 0 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 9 from peg 1 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary)

The last 10 moves could be part of step 2 or step 3, or span both. Let's calculate:
- Total moves for n=10: 2^10 - 1 = 1023
- Moves for step 1 of n=10: 2^9 - 1 = 511
- Move for step 2 of n=10: 1
- Moves for step 3 of n=10: 2^9 - 1 = 511
- Total: 511 + 1 + 511 = 1023 (as expected)

For step 3 of n=10:
- Moves for step 1 of n=9: 2^8 - 1 = 255
- Move for step 2 of n=9: 1
- Moves for step 3 of n=9: 2^8 - 1 = 255
- Total: 255 + 1 + 255 = 511 (as expected)

The last 10 moves (1014-1023) correspond to the last 10 moves of step 3 of n=10, which is part of step 3 of n=9. Specifically, these are the last 10 moves of the process of moving disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary).

For n=8, the moves follow a similar recursive pattern.

I think I'm making this too complicated. Let me simply compute the explicit list of moves for n=10 using the recursive function I defined earlier, and then extract the last 10 moves:

```python
def hanoi_solution(n, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    
    moves = []
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary))
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves

# Generate solution for 10 disks
moves = hanoi_solution(10)

# Extract last 10 moves
last_10_moves = moves[-10:]
for i, move in enumerate(last_10_moves):
    print(f"{1014 + i}. Move disk {move[0]} from peg {move[1]} to peg {move[2]}")
```

Again, this method is too hypothetical.

Let me see if we can determine the last 10 moves by working with the recursive structure directly.

For n=10, the last 10 moves (moves 1014-1023) are part of the process of moving disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary), which is step 3 of the solution for n=10.

I need to understand which part of this process the last 10 moves correspond to.

For n=9 (moving disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary):
1. Move disks 1-8 from peg 1 to peg 0 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 9 from peg 1 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary)

The total number of moves for this process is 2^9 - 1 = 511. Since we're looking at the last 10 moves of the entire solution (moves 1014-1023), these correspond to the last 10 moves of this process.

Step 1 requires 2^8 - 1 = 255 moves.
Step 2 requires 1 move.
Step 3 requires 2^8 - 1 = 255 moves.

So, the last 10 moves (moves 1014-1023) correspond to the last 10 moves of step 3, which is the process of moving disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary).

For n=8 (moving disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1 as auxiliary):
1. Move disks 1-7 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 8 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-7 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)

The total number of moves for this process is 2^8 - 1 = 255. The last 10 moves of this process (moves 246-255) would be the last 10 moves of the entire solution.

Step 1 requires 2^7 - 1 = 127 moves.
Step 2 requires 1 move.
Step 3 requires 2^7 - 1 = 127 moves.

So, the last 10 moves of the entire solution correspond to the last 10 moves of step 3, which is the process of moving disks 1-7 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).

OK, let's do a simpler check. Let's think about what the last move would be. Let's trace this through recursively:

For n=10, we move disks 1-9 from peg 0 to peg 1, then move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2. So, the last step is moving disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2.

For n=9, we move disks 1-8 from peg 1 to peg 0, then move disk 9 from peg 1 to peg 2, then move disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2. So, the last step is moving disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2.

For n=8, we move disks 1-7 from peg 0 to peg 1, then move disk 8 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disks 1-7 from peg 1 to peg 2. So, the last step is moving disks 1-7 from peg 1 to peg 2.

For n=7, we move disks 1-6 from peg 1 to peg 0, then move disk 7 from peg 1 to peg 2, then move disks 1-6 from peg 0 to peg 2. So, the last step is moving disks 1-6 from peg 0 to peg 2.

For n=6, we move disks 1-5 from peg 0 to peg 1, then move disk 6 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disks 1-5 from peg 1 to peg 2. So, the last step is moving disks 1-5 from peg 1 to peg 2.

For n=5, we move disks 1-4 from peg 1 to peg 0, then move disk 5 from peg 1 to peg 2, then move disks 1-4 from peg 0 to peg 2. So, the last step is moving disks 1-4 from peg 0 to peg 2.

For n=4, we move disks 1-3 from peg 0 to peg 1, then move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disks 1-3 from peg 1 to peg 2. So, the last step is moving disks 1-3 from peg 1 to peg 2.

For n=3, we move disks 1-2 from peg 1 to peg 0, then move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2, then move disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2. So, the last step is moving disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2.

For n=2, we move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2. So, the last step is moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.

So, the very last move (move 1023) of the entire solution is moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.

Actually, let me do this more systematically for the last 10 moves.

Move 1023 (the very last move):
From the recursive trace, we determined that this is moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.

Move 1022 (the second-to-last move):
This is part of the process of moving disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (for n=3). Before the last move (moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2), the previous move would be moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.

Move 1021 (the third-to-last move):
Before moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2, we would have moved disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1 (to clear the way for disk 2).

Actually, let me trace through the recursion more carefully to determine the last 10 moves.

For n=10, the last phase is moving disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).
For n=9, the last phase is moving disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary).
For n=8, the last phase is moving disks 1-7 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).
For n=7, the last phase is moving disks 1-6 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary).
For n=6, the last phase is moving disks 1-5 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).
For n=5, the last phase is moving disks 1-4 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary).
For n=4, the last phase is moving disks 1-3 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).
For n=3, the last phase is moving disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary).
For n=2, the last phase is moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.

So the last move (move 1023) is moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.

For the second-to-last move (move 1022), we look at the second-to-last move of the process of moving disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (for n=3). This would be moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.

So, move 1022 is moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.

For the third-to-last move (move 1021), we look at the third-to-last move of the process of moving disks 1-3 from peg 1 to peg 2 (for n=4). Since the last two moves of this process are moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2 and then moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2, the third-to-last move would be moving disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1 (to clear the way for disk 2).

So, move 1021 would be moving disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.

But this doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the recursion:

For n=4, the last phase is moving disks 1-3 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).
This breaks down as:
1. Move disks 1-2 from peg 1 to peg 0 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary)

The last two moves of this phase (step 3) are the last two moves of the process of moving disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2. This would be moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2 and then moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.

But this doesn't account for the third-to-last move of the phase for n=4. Before moving disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2, we would have moved disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2 (step 2 of the phase for n=4).

So, the third-to-last move of the entire solution (move 1021) would be moving disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2.

I think the recursive tracing is getting confusing.

I think the best approach is to explicitly calculate the moves for n=10 using the recursive function I defined earlier, and then extract the last 10 moves.

But I'll take a slightly different approach. Instead of generating all 1023 moves, I'll generate the last 10 moves directly by working backwards.

For n=10, the entire solution consists of:
1. Move disks 1-9 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 10 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)

The last 10 moves are part of step 3. I need to understand which part of step 3 these moves correspond to.

For n=9 (moving disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary):
1. Move disks 1-8 from peg 1 to peg 0 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 9 from peg 1 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary)

Step 1 requires 2^8 - 1 = 255 moves.
Step 2 requires 1 move.
Step 3 requires 2^8 - 1 = 255 moves.

Total for n=9: 255 + 1 + 255 = 511 moves.

Since the total number of moves for n=10 is 1023, and the first 512 moves are for step 1 and step 2 of n=10, the remaining 511 moves are for step 3 of n=10, which is the process of moving disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2.

The last 10 moves of the entire solution (moves 1014-1023) are therefore the last 10 moves of the process of moving disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2.

To identify these moves, I need to understand the last 10 moves of the process of moving disks 1-9 from peg 1 to peg 2.

From the breakdown of the process for n=9, the last 10 moves would be part of step 3, which is moving disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2. Specifically, they would be the last 10 moves of this step.

For n=8 (moving disks 1-8 from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1 as auxiliary):
1. Move disks 1-7 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 8 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-7 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)

Step 1 requires 2^7 - 1 = 127 moves.
Step 2 requires 1 move.
Step 3 requires 2^7 - 1 = 127 moves.

Total for n=8: 127 + 1 + 127 = 255 moves.

The last 10 moves of this process (moves 246-255) would be part of step 3, which is moving disks 1-7 from peg 1 to peg 2. Specifically, they would be the last 10 moves of this step.

For n=7 (moving disks 1-7 from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary):
1. Move disks 1-6 from peg 1 to peg 0 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 7 from peg 1 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-6 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary)

Step 1 requires 2^6 - 1 = 63 moves.
Step 2 requires 1 move.
Step 3 requires 2^6 - 1 = 63 moves.

Total for n=7: 63 + 1 + 63 = 127 moves.

The last 10 moves of this process (moves 118-127) would be part of step 3, which is moving disks 1-6 from peg 0 to peg 2. Specifically, they would be the last 10 moves of this step.

Let's check how many moves we have left in step 3 of n=7:
127 - 118 + 1 = 10 moves.

So the last 10 moves of the process for n=7 are the last 10 moves of step 3, which is moving disks 1-6 from peg 0 to peg 2.

For n=6 (moving disks 1-6 from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1 as auxiliary):
1. Move disks 1-5 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 6 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-5 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)

Step 1 requires 2^5 - 1 = 31 moves.
Step 2 requires 1 move.
Step 3 requires 2^5 - 1 = 31 moves.

Total for n=6: 31 + 1 + 31 = 63 moves.

The last 10 moves of this process (moves 54-63) would be part of step 3, which is moving disks 1-5 from peg 1 to peg 2. Specifically, they would be the last 10 moves of this step.

Let's check how many moves we have left in step 3 of n=6:
63 - 54 + 1 = 10 moves.

So the last 10 moves of the process for n=6 are the last 10 moves of step 3, which is moving disks 1-5 from peg 1 to peg 2.

For n=5 (moving disks 1-5 from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary):
1. Move disks 1-4 from peg 1 to peg 0 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 5 from peg 1 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-4 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary)

Step 1 requires 2^4 - 1 = 15 moves.
Step 2 requires 1 move.
Step 3 requires 2^4 - 1 = 15 moves.

Total for n=5: 15 + 1 + 15 = 31 moves.

The last 10 moves of this process (moves 22-31) would be part of step 3, which is moving disks 1-4 from peg 0 to peg 2. Specifically, they would be the last 10 moves of this step.

Let's check how many moves we have left in step 3 of n=5:
31 - 22 + 1 = 10 moves.

So the last 10 moves of the process for n=5 are the last 10 moves of step 3, which is moving disks 1-4 from peg 0 to peg 2.

For n=4 (moving disks 1-4 from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1 as auxiliary):
1. Move disks 1-3 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-3 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)

Step 1 requires 2^3 - 1 = 7 moves.
Step 2 requires 1 move.
Step 3 requires 2^3 - 1 = 7 moves.

Total for n=4: 7 + 1 + 7 = 15 moves.

The last 10 moves of this process (moves 6-15) would include all of step 3 and part of step 2. Specifically, they would include:
- Move 6: Part of step 1
- Move 7: Part of step 1
- Move 8: Step 2 (moving disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2)
- Moves 9-15: All of step 3 (moving disks 1-3 from peg 1 to peg 2)

Let's compute the first few moves of the process for n=4:
- Move 1-7: Step 1 (moving disks 1-3 from peg 0 to peg 1)
- Move 8: Step 2 (moving disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2)
- Move 9-15: Step 3 (moving disks 1-3 from peg 1 to peg 2)

So, the last 10 moves of the process for n=4 (moves 6-15) include:
- Move 6-7: The last 2 moves of step 1
- Move 8: Step 2
- Move 9-15: All of step 3

This doesn't seem to match. Let me double-check the math:
For n=4, the total number of moves is 2^4 - 1 = 15.
The last 10 moves would be moves 6-15.
Step 1 requires 2^3 - 1 = 7 moves, which are moves 1-7.
Step 2 requires 1 move, which is move 8.
Step 3 requires 2^3 - 1 = 7 moves, which are moves 9-15.

So the last 10 moves of the process for n=4 would be:
- Move 6-7: The last 2 moves of step 1
- Move 8: Step 2
- Move 9-15: All of step 3

Oops, that's not 10 moves. Let me double-check: 7 - 6 + 1 + 1 + 7 = 2 + 1 + 7 = 10 moves. So it checks out.

The last 10 moves of the process for n=4 are:
- Move 6-7: The last 2 moves of step 1
- Move 8: Step 2
- Move 9-15: All of step 3

So the last 10 moves of the entire solution (moves 1014-1023) are:
- Moves 1014-1015: The last 2 moves of the process of moving disks 1-3 from peg 0 to peg 1 (for n=4)
- Move 1016: Moving disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2
- Moves 1017-1023: All 7 moves of the process of moving disks 1-3 from peg 1 to peg 2 (for n=4)

Let's trace through this for n=3 to identify exactly what these moves are.

For n=3 (moving disks 1-3 from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2 as auxiliary):
1. Move disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1
3. Move disks 1-2 from peg 2 to peg 1 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)

Step 1 requires 2^2 - 1 = 3 moves.
Step 2 requires 1 move.
Step 3 requires 2^2 - 1 = 3 moves.

Total for n=3: 3 + 1 + 3 = 7 moves.

The last 2 moves of step 1 would be the last 2 moves of the process of moving disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2.

For n=2 (moving disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1 as auxiliary):
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2

Total for n=2: 3 moves.

So the last 2 moves of the process of moving disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2 are:
- Moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
- Moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2

Therefore, moves 1014-1015 of the entire solution are:
- Move 1014: Moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
- Move 1015: Moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2

Move 1016 is moving disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2.

Moves 1017-1023 are all 7 moves of the process of moving disks 1-3 from peg 1 to peg 2.

For n=3 (moving disks 1-3 from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary):
1. Move disks 1-2 from peg 1 to peg 0 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary)

So, moves 1017-1023 are:
- Moves 1017-1019: Step 1 (moving disks 1-2 from peg 1 to peg 0)
- Move 1020: Step 2 (moving disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2)
- Moves 1021-1023: Step 3 (moving disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2)

For n=2 (moving disks 1-2 from peg 1 to peg 0 using peg 2 as auxiliary):
1. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
2. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0

So, moves 1017-1019 are:
- Move 1017: Moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
- Move 1018: Moving disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0
- Move 1019: Moving disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0

Move 1020 is moving disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2.

For n=2 (moving disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1 as auxiliary):
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2

So, moves 1021-1023 are:
- Move 1021: Moving disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
- Move 1022: Moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
- Move 1023: Moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2

So, the last 10 moves of the entire solution (moves 1014-1023) are:
- Move 1014: Moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
- Move 1015: Moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
- Move 1016: Moving disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2
- Move 1017: Moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
- Move 1018: Moving disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0
- Move 1019: Moving disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0
- Move 1020: Moving disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2
- Move 1021: Moving disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
- Move 1022: Moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
- Move 1023: Moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2

Let me double-check this by calculating the moves for n=3 (moving disks 1-3 from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary):

For n=3:
1. Move disks 1-2 from peg 1 to peg 0 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1 as auxiliary)

For step 1 (moving disks 1-2 from peg 1 to peg 0 using peg 2 as auxiliary):
1. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
2. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0

Step 2 is moving disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2.

For step 3 (moving disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1 as auxiliary):
1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2

So the 7 moves for n=3 are:
1. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
2. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0
4. Move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2
5. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
6. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
7. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2

This matches our derivation for moves 1017-1023 of the entire solution.

Now let's verify moves 1014-1016:
- Move 1014: Moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
- Move 1015: Moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
- Move 1016: Moving disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2

These are the last 2 moves of the process of moving disks 1-2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (for n=2), followed by moving disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2.

So the last 10 moves of the entire solution (moves 1014-1023) are:
- Move 1014: Moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
- Move 1015: Moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
- Move 1016: Moving disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2
- Move 1017: Moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2
- Move 1018: Moving disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0
- Move 1019: Moving disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0
- Move 1020: Moving disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2
- Move 1021: Moving disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1
- Move 1022: Moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2
- Move 1023: Moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2

Actually, I think I need to review the recursive structure because I'm not completely sure of the steps. Let me just use the function I defined earlier to compute the solution for n=10, and then extract the last 10 moves.

In the required format, the last 10 moves of the solution for n=10 are:
- Move 1014: [2, 0, 2]
- Move 1015: [1, 1, 2]
- Move 1016: [4, 0, 2]
- Move 1017: [1, 1, 2]
- Move 1018: [2, 1, 0]
- Move 1019: [1, 2, 0]
- Move 1020: [3, 1, 2]
- Move 1021: [1, 0, 1]
- Move 1022: [2, 0, 2]
- Move 1023: [1, 1, 2]

So my answer for the 10-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle is to use the recursive algorithm:

```python
def hanoi_solution(n, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    
    moves = []
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary))
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves

# Generate solution for 10 disks
moves = hanoi_solution(10)
```

This function would generate all 1023 moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 10 disks, starting from peg 0 and ending at peg 2.

Let's format this correctly for the solution:
```
moves = hanoi_solution(10)
```

Actually, I've been thinking about this problem from the perspective of a recursive function generating all the moves. The problem statement mentions a list of disks moved from one peg to another peg. So I should actually think about the problem a bit differently.

In the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, we need to specify which disk is being moved, not just which peg the disk is moved from and to. So the required format should be:
```
moves = [[disk, from_peg, to_peg], ...]
```

where `disk` is the disk number (1 for smallest, 10 for largest), `from_peg` is the peg the disk is moved from, and `to_peg` is the peg the disk is moved to.

Let me update my function to compute the solution in this format:

```python
def hanoi_solution(n, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    
    moves = []
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary))
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves

# Generate solution for 10 disks
moves = hanoi_solution(10)
```

So the final solution for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 10 disks is:

```
moves = hanoi_solution(10)
```

where `hanoi_solution` is the recursive function I defined above. This solution generates all 1023 moves required to solve the puzzle, specifying which disk is moved from which peg to which peg at each step.

That's my complete answer:
```
def hanoi_solution(n, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    
    moves = []
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary))
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves

# Generate solution for 10 disks
moves = hanoi_solution(10)
```

This recursive function generates all 1023 moves for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 10 disks, starting from peg 0 and ending at peg 2.

# Tower of Hanoi Solution for 10 Disks

This is the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle. I'll solve it using a recursive approach.

## Understanding the Problem

For the Tower of Hanoi with n disks, the minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1. With 10 disks, we need 2^10 - 1 = 1023 moves.

## Recursive Solution

The Tower of Hanoi has an elegant recursive solution:
1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary peg (using destination as auxiliary)
2. Move the largest disk from source to destination
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination (using source as auxiliary)

## Implementation

```python
def hanoi_solution(n, source=0, auxiliary=1, destination=2):
    if n == 1:
        return [[1, source, destination]]
    
    moves = []
    
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary))
    
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append([n, source, destination])
    
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    moves.extend(hanoi_solution(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination))
    
    return moves
```

## Complete List of Moves

For 10 disks, this generates 1023 moves. Here's the complete list:

moves = [[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1],
