# Tower of Hanoi Solution for 5 Disks

This is the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 5 disks. I'll solve it step by step.

## Approach

The Tower of Hanoi has a recursive solution. For n disks:
1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary peg
2. Move the largest disk from source to destination peg
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination peg

## Solution for 5 Disks

Let me work out the complete sequence of moves:

```
Initial state: [[5,4,3,2,1], [], []]
```

I'll generate all moves to transfer 5 disks from peg 0 to peg 2:

1. Move disks 1-4 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)
2. Move disk 5 from peg 0 to peg 2
3. Move disks 1-4 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)

Expanding this recursively gives us the complete solution:

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], 
    [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2], [4, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], 
    [1, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], 
    [5, 0, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], 
    [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1], [4, 1, 2], [1, 1, 0], 
    [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2], [3, 1, 0], [1, 2, 1], [2, 0, 1], 
    [1, 1, 0]
]
```

This sequence requires 31 moves, which matches the formula 2^n - 1 = 2^5 - 1 = 31 for the minimum number of moves needed to solve the Tower of Hanoi with n disks.

The final state will be:
```
[[],[],[5,4,3,2,1]]
```

Which satisfies our goal configuration of having all 5 disks on peg 2 in the correct order.
