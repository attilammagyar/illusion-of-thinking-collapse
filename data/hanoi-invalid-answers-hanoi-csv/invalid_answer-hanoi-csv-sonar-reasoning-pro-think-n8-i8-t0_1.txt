Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 8 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves in CSV format without any explanation. First, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursion problem. The minimum number of moves required for n disks is 2^n - 1, so for 8 disks, that's 255 moves. The challenge is to generate all those moves correctly.

The recursive approach involves moving the top n-1 disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg, then moving the nth disk to the target peg, and finally moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg. For 8 disks, this would involve a lot of repetitive steps. But since the user wants the exact sequence, I need to make sure each move is correct.

Looking at the example provided for 3 disks, the moves follow a pattern. For even and odd numbers of disks, the direction of moving the smallest disk alternates. Since 8 is even, the initial moves of disk 1 should be between pegs 0 and 2, then 0 and 1, etc. But I need to confirm the exact pattern.

The search results mention that for 8 disks, the solution requires 255 moves. The example in the video might show the pattern, but the transcripts don't give the exact steps. However, the recursive method is standard. Each move can be determined by the recursive steps, but implementing that without code might be error-prone.

Alternatively, there's an iterative approach: for each move, alternate moving the smallest disk (always in the same direction, which depends on whether n is even or odd) and making the only other valid move. For even n, the smallest disk moves in a specific direction each time. Since 8 is even, disk 1 moves from 0→2, then 0→1, then 2→1, etc. But I need to ensure that each subsequent move follows the rules.

Wait, the iterative method steps are:
1. Move the smallest disk to the next peg in a clockwise direction (if even) or counterclockwise (if odd). For even n, direction is 0→1→2→0, etc.
2. Make the only other valid move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.
3. Repeat until solved.

But I need to map this correctly. Let's see. For 8 disks (even), the smallest disk (1) moves in a clockwise direction each time. So the first move is 0→2, then 0→1, then 1→2, then 2→0, etc. Wait, maybe it's a cycle of 0→1→2→0 for even n. Wait, no, the direction depends on the parity. For even n, the smallest disk moves in a specific direction each time. Let me check.

Alternatively, the standard solution for Tower of Hanoi can be generated using a recursive function. Let's try to outline the moves for 8 disks using recursion.

The recursive function would be something like:
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"1,{source},{target}")
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        print(f"{n},{source},{target}")
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

For n=8, the initial call is hanoi(8, 0, 2, 1). This would generate all the moves. But since I can't run code here, I need to simulate this recursion manually or find a pattern.

Alternatively, the moves can be determined by the binary representation of the move numbers. Each move corresponds to a bit in binary, but that might be more complex.

Another approach is to note that the moves for the smallest disk (1) occur every alternate move. For 8 disks, the total moves are 255. The moves for disk 1 are on moves 1, 3, 5, ..., 255. Each time, it moves in a cycle. For even n, the cycle is 0→2→1→0→2→1..., so the first move is 0→2, then 2→1, then 1→0, etc. Wait, maybe for even n, the direction is 0→2→1→0→2→1..., and for odd n, it's 0→1→2→0→1→2...

But I need to confirm. Let's take the example given for 3 disks (odd). The moves for disk 1 are:
1,0,2
1,2,1
1,1,0
1,0,2

Which follows the pattern 0→2→1→0→2. So for odd n, the direction is 0→1→2→0... Wait, no. The example for 3 disks has disk 1 moving 0→2, then 2→1, then 1→0, then 0→2. That's a cycle of 0→2→1→0→2. Hmm, maybe the direction depends on the number of disks. Alternatively, the parity of the disk number. Wait, disk 1 is the smallest, and its movement direction alternates based on the total number of disks. For even n, disk 1 moves 0→1→2→0..., and for odd n, 0→2→1→0... Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, in the standard Tower of Hanoi solution, the smallest disk moves in a circular pattern. For an even number of disks, it moves clockwise (0→1→2→0), and for odd, counterclockwise (0→2→1→0). But I need to verify this.

Wait, in the example given for 3 disks (odd), the first move of disk 1 is 0→2, which would be counterclockwise. Then next move is 2→1 (counterclockwise from 2 would be to 1), then 1→0, then 0→2 again. So that's consistent with counterclockwise movement for odd n. So for even n (8), the smallest disk moves clockwise: 0→1→2→0...

But how does this translate into the actual moves? Let's try to outline the first few moves for 8 disks.

Move 1: disk 1 from 0→1 (if even, clockwise). Wait, but in the example for 3 disks (odd), the first move is 0→2. So maybe for even n, the first move of disk 1 is 0→1, but that contradicts the example. Wait, the example for 3 disks (odd) starts with 0→2. So perhaps the direction is based on the parity of the number of disks. For even n, the smallest disk moves clockwise (0→1→2→0), and for odd n, counterclockwise (0→2→1→0). So for 8 disks (even), the first move of disk 1 is 0→1, then 1→2, then 2→0, etc.

But wait, in the example for 3 disks, the first move is 0→2, which is counterclockwise, consistent with odd n. So for even n=8, the first move of disk 1 should be 0→1. But let's check the standard solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the direction is determined by the parity of the disk number. For even-numbered disks, move clockwise, and for odd, counterclockwise. But disk 1 is odd, so for n=8 (even total disks), the direction might be different.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to generate the moves using the recursive method, step by step, but for 8 disks, that's 255 moves. Manually doing this is impossible, but perhaps there's a pattern.

Alternatively, the solution can be generated by noting that each move alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only other possible move. For even n, the smallest disk moves in a clockwise direction each time. So the sequence would be:

1. Move disk 1 from 0→1
2. Make the only other possible move (which would be disk 2 from 0→2)
3. Move disk 1 from 1→2
4. Move disk 3 from 0→1
5. Move disk 1 from 2→0
6. Move disk 2 from 2→1
7. Move disk 1 from 0→1
8. Move disk 4 from 0→2
... and so on.

But this seems tedious. However, the user insists on the complete list, so I need to find a way to generate all 255 moves correctly.

Alternatively, I can refer to the search results. The first search result mentions a video showing the solution for 8 disks with 255 moves. The third search result also mentions a video explaining the solution for 8 disks. However, the transcripts don't provide the exact move list. The fourth search result from cs.utexas.edu explains the recursive approach but doesn't list all moves. The fifth search result from chessandpoker.com discusses a seven-disk solution with an algorithm involving moving disk 1 left repeatedly, but the exact steps for 8 disks aren't provided.

Given that the user wants the raw move list without explanation, I need to generate it programmatically. Since I can't run code here, I have to rely on the standard recursive solution. Let's outline the recursive steps for 8 disks.

The recursive approach for moving 8 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1 as auxiliary:

1. Move the top 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2 as auxiliary.
2. Move disk 8 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move the 7 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0 as auxiliary.

Each of these steps involves breaking down into smaller subproblems. For example, moving 7 disks requires moving 6 disks first, and so on. This recursive breakdown generates the sequence of moves.

However, listing all 255 moves manually is impractical. But perhaps there's a pattern or a way to represent the moves systematically. For example, the moves for disk k occur at specific intervals. The largest disk (8) moves only once, from 0→2. The next largest (7) moves twice, and so on. Each disk's moves are spaced in a pattern based on powers of 2.

Alternatively, the sequence of moves can be determined using the binary representation of the move numbers. Each move corresponds to a bit flip in a binary counter, but I'm not sure about the exact mapping.

Another approach is to note that the sequence of moves follows a specific pattern where each disk alternates between moving in a certain direction. For even-numbered disks, the direction is different from odd-numbered ones.

Given the complexity, the safest way is to generate the moves using the recursive algorithm and ensure that each move adheres to the rules. Since I can't write code here, I'll have to mentally simulate the recursive steps for 8 disks, which is time-consuming but necessary.

Starting with n=8, source=0, target=2, auxiliary=1:

1. Move 7 disks from 0→1 using 2 as auxiliary.
   - This involves moving 6 disks from 0→2 using 1 as auxiliary, then moving disk 7 from 0→1, then moving 6 disks from 2→1 using 0 as auxiliary.
   - This process repeats recursively.

Each time a disk is moved, it's recorded. The challenge is to track all these moves without error. Given the depth of recursion, it's easy to make mistakes, but since the user requires accuracy, I must proceed carefully.

Alternatively, I can look for a pattern in the move sequence. For example, the moves for 3 disks are:

1,0,2
2,0,1
1,2,1
3,0,2
1,1,0
2,1,2
1,0,2

For 3 disks, the sequence is 7 moves. The largest disk (3) moves once. The next (2) moves twice, and the smallest (1) moves four times.

Extending this to 8 disks, each disk k will move 2^(8-k) times. So disk 1 moves 128 times, disk 2 moves 64 times, ..., disk 8 moves once.

The order of moves can be determined by the binary representation. Each move of disk k occurs every 2^(k) moves. For example, disk 1 moves every odd-numbered move, disk 2 every 2nd move (starting at move 2), etc.

But how to determine the from and to pegs for each disk's move? The direction depends on the disk's parity. For disk 1 (smallest), the direction alternates based on the total number of disks. For even n=8, disk 1 moves in a clockwise direction (0→1→2→0...). For each subsequent disk, the direction alternates. For example, disk 2 moves in the opposite direction of disk 1, and so on.

Alternatively, each disk's movement direction is determined by whether the disk number is even or odd. Even-numbered disks move in one direction, odd in the other. But I'm not entirely sure.

Given the time constraints and the need for accuracy, I'll proceed to generate the move list based on the recursive approach, ensuring that each move follows the rules. Here's the step-by-step generation:

1. The first move for 8 disks is to start moving the top 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 1. This involves a recursive call to move 7 disks.

But to list all 255 moves, I need to simulate the entire recursion. This is tedious, but let's try to outline the first few moves:

Move 1: Move disk 1 from 0→2 (since in the recursive step, moving 7 disks from 0→1 requires moving 6 disks from 0→2 first, which starts with moving disk 1 to 2).

Wait, no. Let's clarify. For moving 7 disks from 0→1 using 2 as auxiliary:

- First, move 6 disks from 0→2 using 1 as auxiliary.
   - Which requires moving 5 disks from 0→1 using 2 as auxiliary.
      - And so on until we reach the base case.

This nested recursion makes it hard to track, but the initial moves would involve moving the smallest disks back and forth. For example, the first few moves for 8 disks would be similar to the 3-disk example but scaled up.

Alternatively, the first move for 8 disks should be moving disk 1 from 0→1 (if even n), but I'm not certain. Given the example for 3 disks (odd n) starts with 0→2, perhaps for even n=8, the first move is 0→1.

But I need to confirm. Let's think: for even n, the smallest disk moves clockwise (0→1→2→0), and for odd n, counterclockwise (0→2→1→0). So for n=8 (even), disk 1's first move is 0→1. Then the next non-disk-1 move would be the only other possible move, which is disk 2 from 0→2. Then disk 1 moves from 1→2. Then disk 3 from 0→1, and so on.

But this is speculative. Without a concrete example, it's risky. However, given the user's requirement, I must proceed.

Alternatively, I can refer to the chessandpoker.com source (search result 5), which mentions an algorithm for solving the Tower of Hanoi. For a seven-disk puzzle, they describe moving disk 1 to the left repeatedly. For even-numbered disks, the direction might differ. But the exact steps for 8 disks aren't provided.

Given the lack of explicit move lists in the search results, I have to rely on the standard recursive solution. Therefore, the correct move list for 8 disks moving from peg 0 to peg 2 is generated by the recursive algorithm, which I'll simulate here.

The recursive function for n=8, source=0, target=2, auxiliary=1:

hanoi(8, 0, 2, 1) calls:
hanoi(7, 0, 1, 2)
move disk 8 from 0→2
hanoi(7, 1, 2, 0)

Each hanoi(7, ...) call further breaks down into moving 6 disks, etc.

The base case is when n=1, move the disk directly.

This recursive breakdown will generate all 255 moves. However, simulating this manually is error-prone. To ensure accuracy, I'll outline the first few moves and then recognize the pattern.

For example, the first few moves for 8 disks would involve moving disk 1 back and forth between pegs as the recursion unwinds. The exact sequence is complex, but the key is that each move adheres to the rules and builds towards the final configuration.

After careful consideration, the correct move list is generated by the recursive algorithm, and the CSV output should follow the exact order of moves as per the recursion. Therefore, the final answer is the complete list of 255 moves in the specified format.
