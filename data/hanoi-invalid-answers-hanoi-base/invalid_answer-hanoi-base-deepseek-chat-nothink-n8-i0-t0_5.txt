Alright, let's tackle the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 8 disks. I'll approach this step by step, making sure to follow the rules and keep track of each move.

### Understanding the Problem

We have three pegs: Peg 0, Peg 1, and Peg 2. Initially, all 8 disks are on Peg 0, stacked from largest (8) at the bottom to smallest (1) at the top. The goal is to move all disks to Peg 2, following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Only the top disk of a stack can be moved.
3. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

### Strategy

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive problem. The general strategy for moving `n` disks from a source peg to a target peg using an auxiliary peg is:

1. Move `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.
2. Move the nth disk (the largest one) from the source peg to the target peg.
3. Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.

This approach can be applied recursively until we're moving single disks.

### Solving for 8 Disks

Let's apply this strategy to our 8 disks. We'll define the pegs as follows:
- Source peg (initial position): Peg 0
- Auxiliary peg: Peg 1
- Target peg: Peg 2

We'll recursively move disks from Peg 0 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as needed.

### Step-by-Step Moves

Here's the sequence of moves to solve the puzzle. Each move will be represented as `[disk, from_peg, to_peg]`.

Let's start:

1. Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
2. Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.
3. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.
4. Move disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
