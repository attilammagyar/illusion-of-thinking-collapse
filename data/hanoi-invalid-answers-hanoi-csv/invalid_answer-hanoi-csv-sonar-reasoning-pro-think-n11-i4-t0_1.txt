Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 11 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation. First, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi solution follows a recursive pattern. For n disks, the minimum number of moves is 2^n - 1. For 11 disks, that's 2047 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

The standard recursive approach is: move n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg, move the nth disk from source to target, then move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to target. Each of these steps involves recursive calls. But since we need to generate every single move, we have to translate this recursion into an iterative sequence.

Looking at the search results, the formula S = 2^N - 1 is mentioned, which aligns with the 2047 moves needed. The example with 3 disks shows a specific sequence. Also, the video mentions moving layers step-by-step, which probably follows the same recursive logic but applied iteratively.

The challenge is to generate all 2047 moves correctly. Each move alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. The pattern for the smallest disk is moving it in a cyclic manner: if there are an odd number of disks, the smallest moves in a cycle (0->2, 2->1, 1->0), and for even, it's different. Wait, no, actually, the standard pattern is that for each move of a non-smallest disk, the smallest disk is moved alternately. But with 11 disks (odd), the initial move of disk 1 is from peg 0 to peg 2.

But generating each move step-by-step manually isn't feasible. Instead, I need to implement the iterative algorithm. The iterative solution for Tower of Hanoi involves making the legal move between pegs A and B, then between A and C, then between B and C, repeating until done. However, this might not directly apply here.

Alternatively, the binary representation method: each move corresponds to a binary counter, where each bit represents a disk. But I'm not sure how to map that to actual disk movements.

Wait, another approach is to note that each disk moves in a pattern. For example, disk 1 moves every 2^0 steps, disk 2 every 2^1 steps, etc. The direction of movement depends on whether the disk number is odd or even. For an odd number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a cycle (0->2, 2->1, 1->0), while for even, it's (0->1, 1->2, 2->0). Since we have 11 disks (odd), the smallest disk's direction is 0->2->1->0...

Each larger disk moves once every 2^(k-1) steps, where k is the disk number. For disk 1 (smallest), moves every 1 step. Disk 2 every 2 steps, disk 3 every 4 steps, etc. The direction for each disk is determined by its parity. For odd-numbered disks (like 1,3,5,...), they follow the same direction as the smallest disk. Even-numbered disks move in the opposite direction.

So, for each move number from 1 to 2047, we can determine which disk to move and where. Let's formalize this:

For each move m (starting at 1):
1. Find the largest power of 2 that divides m. Let that be 2^(d-1), so disk d is moved.
2. Determine the direction for disk d. If d is odd, follow the smallest disk's direction (0->2->1->0...). If d is even, move in the opposite direction (0->1->2->0...).
3. The current position of disk d can be tracked, but alternatively, since each disk's moves are periodic, we can compute the source and target pegs based on the move count.

But tracking the positions of all disks might be complex. Alternatively, using the iterative algorithm steps:

In the iterative approach, the moves are determined by the following rules:
- For odd total disks:
  - Make the legal move between peg 0 and peg 2.
  - Then between peg 0 and peg 1.
  - Then between peg 1 and peg 2.
  - Repeat until complete.
- For even total disks, swap peg 1 and peg 2 in the above steps.

But with 11 disks (odd), the order is 0<->2, 0<->1, 1<->2, repeating.

However, this might not directly give the disk numbers, just the peg movements. So perhaps combining both methods: determine which disk is moved each time based on the move number, and then determine the direction based on the disk's parity.

Alternatively, use the recursive approach to generate the sequence. Since the recursive solution for n disks involves moving n-1 disks from source to auxiliary, then moving the nth disk, then moving n-1 disks from auxiliary to target. Translating this into an explicit list of moves would require unfolding the recursion.

But generating this programmatically is beyond my current capability. However, given that the user provided an example for 3 disks, perhaps there's a pattern to extrapolate.

Looking at the example for 3 disks:

The moves are:
1,0,2
2,0,1
1,2,1
3,0,2
1,1,0
2,1,2
1,0,2

This follows the recursive steps:
- Move disks 1-2 from 0 to 1 (using 3 as auxiliary).
- Move disk 3 from 0 to 2.
- Move disks 1-2 from 1 to 2 (using 0 as auxiliary).

Each of these steps is itself a recursive call. For 11 disks, the sequence would be massive, but the pattern would follow the same logic, just deeper recursion.

However, manually writing out 2047 moves is impossible. The user expects the assistant to generate this list, which suggests that there's a formulaic way to produce each move without tracking each step manually.

Another approach is to note that each disk's moves follow a specific pattern. For example, disk 1 moves every other move, disk 2 every four moves, etc. The direction alternates based on the disk's position in the sequence.

But to generate the exact sequence, perhaps the best way is to implement the standard iterative algorithm for Tower of Hanoi, which alternates between moving the smallest disk and the next legal move. Here's how it works:

1. Initialize three pegs: source (0), auxiliary (1), target (2).
2. The total number of moves is 2^11 - 1 = 2047.
3. For each move from 1 to 2047:
   a. If the move number is odd, move the smallest disk (disk 1) to the next peg in the cycle. For odd total disks, the cycle is 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0...
   b. If the move number is even, make the only legal move not involving the smallest disk.

This way, the smallest disk is moved every other move, and the other moves are determined by the legal options between the remaining pegs.

Implementing this logic, we can generate each move step by step. Let's try to outline how this would work for 11 disks.

Since the total disks are odd (11), the smallest disk (1) moves in the cycle 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0...

For each odd move (1,3,5,...), move disk 1 according to this cycle.

For even moves, determine which of the other two pegs (not containing disk 1) has the smaller top disk, and move that disk between the two non-1 pegs.

But tracking the state of each peg after each move is necessary, which is complex. However, given that the user requires the complete list, the assistant must have a way to generate it.

Alternatively, using the binary representation method. Each move corresponds to a binary digit, and the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move number. For example, move 1 in binary is 1, which has 0 trailing zeros, so disk 1 is moved. Move 2 is 10, which has 1 trailing zero, so disk 2. Move 3 is 11, 0 trailing zeros, disk 1. Move 4 is 100, 2 trailing zeros, disk 3, etc.

The direction for each disk is determined by whether the disk number is odd or even. For odd disks, the direction is 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0... For even disks, it's 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0...

So, for each move m from 1 to 2047:

1. Find the number of trailing zeros in m's binary representation. Let that be k. Then, the disk to move is k + 1.
2. Determine the direction based on the disk's parity (odd or even).
3. Determine the current peg of the disk. Since the disk moves in a cycle, the number of times it has been moved before determines its current position.

Wait, but how to track the current peg of each disk? That's the tricky part. Alternatively, the direction can be determined by the disk's parity and the total number of disks.

For example, for an odd number of total disks (11):

- Odd-numbered disks (1,3,5,...) move in the cycle 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0...
- Even-numbered disks (2,4,6,...) move in the cycle 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0...

Each time a disk is moved, it follows its respective cycle.

But how to determine the source and target pegs for each move of a disk?

Let's take disk d. The number of times it has been moved before move m is equal to the number of times it has been moved, which is floor((m + 1)/2^(d)) ). Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, each disk d moves every 2^(d) moves. The first move of disk d is at move 2^(d-1). Then, it moves again every 2^(d) moves.

For example, disk 1 moves at moves 1,3,5,7,... (every 2 moves)
Disk 2 moves at moves 2,6,10,14,... (every 4 moves)
Disk 3 moves at moves 4,12,20,... (every 8 moves)
And so on.

Each time a disk moves, it alternates between the two possible pegs (based on its direction cycle). For disk 1 (odd), the first move is from 0 to 2, then 2 to 1, then 1 to 0, etc.

So, for each disk d:

- The first move is from peg 0 to peg 2 if d is odd, or peg 0 to peg 1 if d is even.
- Subsequent moves alternate between the two possible pegs in their respective cycles.

But how to determine the source and target for each move of disk d?

Alternatively, for each move m, determine which disk is being moved (as per trailing zeros), then determine the direction based on the disk's parity, and then compute the source and target pegs based on the number of times the disk has been moved before.

For example, disk d is moved at moves m = 2^{d-1}, 3*2^{d-1}, 5*2^{d-1}, etc.

The number of times disk d has been moved before move m is k = floor((m - 2^{d-1}) / (2^d)) ) + 1.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to note that each disk d moves exactly 2^{n - d} times, where n is the total number of disks. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for each move m:

1. Find d such that m = (2k - 1) * 2^{d-1}, where k is a positive integer. Then, disk d is moved.

For example, for m=1: 1 = (2*1 -1)*2^{0} → d=1
m=2: 2 = (2*1 -1)*2^{1} → d=2
m=3: 3 = (2*2 -1)*2^{0} → d=1
m=4: 4 = (2*1 -1)*2^{2} → d=3
m=5: 5 = (2*3 -1)*2^{0} → d=1
And so on.

Once d is determined, the direction is based on d's parity. For odd d, the movement cycle is 0→2→1→0..., for even d, 0→1→2→0...

The number of times disk d has been moved before this move is k = floor((m - 2^{d-1}) / 2^d) ) + 1. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the sequence of moves for disk d is every 2^d moves, starting at 2^{d-1}.

For example, disk 1 starts at move 1, then every 2 moves: 1,3,5,7,...
Disk 2 starts at move 2, then every 4 moves: 2,6,10,14,...
Disk 3 starts at move 4, then every 8 moves:4,12,20,...

So for disk d, the moves are at positions 2^{d-1} + k*2^d for k=0,1,2,...

Each time disk d is moved, it alternates between the two pegs in its cycle. For odd d, the first move is from 0 to 2, then 2 to 1, then 1 to 0, etc. For even d, first move is from 0 to 1, then 1 to 2, then 2 to 0, etc.

So, for each move of disk d:

- If it's the first move (k=0), source is 0, target is 2 if d is odd, 1 if even.
- Second move (k=1), source is previous target, target is next in cycle.
- And so on.

But how to track the current peg for each disk? Since the Tower of Hanoi problem ensures that each disk is only on top of larger disks, the position of each disk can be determined by its movement pattern.

Alternatively, since all disks start on peg 0, and each disk d is moved exactly 2^{d-1} times, the direction can be determined by the number of times it has been moved modulo 3 (for the cycle).

Wait, for odd d, the cycle is 0→2→1→0..., which is a cycle of 3 steps. Each move of disk d alternates between these. So, if the disk has been moved t times, the source and target can be determined by t mod 3.

But for each move of disk d, the direction depends on whether it's the first, second, third move, etc.

For example, disk 1 (odd):

- Move 1: 0→2 (t=0, t mod 3 =0 → source 0, target 2)
- Move 3: 2→1 (t=1, t mod 3=1 → source 2, target 1)
- Move 5: 1→0 (t=2, t mod 3=2 → source 1, target 0)
- Move 7: 0→2 (t=3, t mod 3=0 → source 0, target 2)
And so on.

Similarly, disk 2 (even):

- Move 2: 0→1 (t=0, t mod 3=0 → source 0, target 1)
- Move 6: 1→2 (t=1, t mod 3=1 → source 1, target 2)
- Move 10: 2→0 (t=2, t mod 3=2 → source 2, target 0)
- Move 14: 0→1 (t=3, t mod 3=0 → source 0, target 1)
Etc.

So, for each disk d, the number of times it has been moved before the current move is t = floor((m - 2^{d-1}) / 2^d) ), where m is the current move number. Then, the source and target are determined by (t mod 3) for the cycle.

But how to compute this for each move?

Alternatively, for each move m:

1. Determine the disk d by finding the number of trailing zeros in m's binary representation plus 1. For example, m=1 (binary 1) has 0 trailing zeros → d=1. m=2 (10) has 1 trailing zero → d=2. m=4 (100) has 2 trailing zeros → d=3, etc.

2. For disk d, determine the direction cycle based on parity:
   - If d is odd: cycle is 0→2→1→0...
   - If d is even: cycle is 0→1→2→0...

3. The number of times disk d has been moved before this move is t = (m / 2^{d}) ). Wait, perhaps t = (m - 2^{d-1}) / 2^{d} + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, the sequence of moves for disk d is at positions 2^{d-1}, 3*2^{d-1}, 5*2^{d-1}, etc. So for each move m of disk d, it's the k-th move, where k = (m / 2^{d-1} + 1)/2. For example, for d=1, m=1,3,5,... k=1,2,3,...

Then, the source and target pegs are determined by the cycle. For each k-th move of disk d:

- For odd d: the moves are 0→2, 2→1, 1→0, 0→2, etc.
- For even d: 0→1, 1→2, 2→0, 0→1, etc.

So, for the k-th move of disk d:

- If d is odd: the source peg is (3 - (k-1) mod 3 -1) ? Wait, perhaps better to model the cycle as a list and index it by (k-1) mod 3.

For example, for odd d:

Cycle: [0→2, 2→1, 1→0]
For k=1: 0→2
k=2: 2→1
k=3: 1→0
k=4: 0→2 again

Similarly, for even d:

Cycle: [0→1, 1→2, 2→0]
k=1: 0→1
k=2:1→2
k=3:2→0
k=4:0→1

So, for each disk d, the k-th move (starting at 1) uses the (k-1) mod 3 index of the cycle.

Thus, the source and target pegs can be determined as follows:

For disk d:

- If d is odd:
   cycle = [(0,2), (2,1), (1,0)]
- If d is even:
   cycle = [(0,1), (1,2), (2,0)]

Then, for the k-th move of disk d:

index = (k-1) mod 3
(source, target) = cycle[index]

But how to compute k for a given move m?

For disk d, the moves occur at positions m = (2k -1) * 2^{d-1}, where k starts at 1.

So, for a given m, k = (m / 2^{d-1} + 1)/2

For example, for d=1, m=1: k=(1/1 +1)/2 =1
m=3: k=(3/1 +1)/2=2
m=5: k=3, etc.

Thus, k = (m // 2^{d-1} +1) // 2

Once k is determined, compute index = (k-1) mod 3, then get (source, target) from the cycle.

Putting this all together:

For each move m from 1 to 2047:

1. Find d = number of trailing zeros in binary(m) +1
2. Determine if d is odd or even to select the cycle.
3. Compute k = ((m // 2^{d-1}) +1) // 2
4. index = (k-1) mod 3
5. (source, target) = cycle[index]
6. Output "d,source,target"

This should generate the correct sequence.

Testing this with the example for 3 disks:

Move 1:
d=1 (trailing zeros in 1 (0b1) is 0)
odd cycle
k= ((1//1)+1)/2 = (1+1)/2=1
index=0
source=0, target=2 → move 1,0,2

Move 2:
binary 2 is 10, trailing zeros=1 → d=2
even cycle
k= ((2//2)+1)/2 = (1+1)/2=1
index=0
source=0, target=1 → move 2,0,1

Move3:
binary 3 is 11, trailing zeros=0 →d=1
odd cycle
k= ((3//1)+1)/2=(3+1)/2=2
index=1
source=2, target=1 → move 1,2,1

Move4:
binary4=100, trailing zeros=2 →d=3
odd cycle
k= ((4//4)+1)/2= (1+1)/2=1
index=0
source=0, target=2 → move3,0,2

Move5:
binary5=101, trailing zeros=0 →d=1
k= ((5//1)+1)/2= (5+1)/2=3
index=2
source=1, target=0 → move1,1,0

Move6:
binary6=110, trailing zeros=1 →d=2
even cycle
k= ((6//2)+1)/2= (3+1)/2=2
index=1
source=1, target=2 → move2,1,2

Move7:
binary7=111, trailing zeros=0 →d=1
k= ((7//1)+1)/2= (7+1)/2=4
index=3 mod3=0
source=0, target=2 → move1,0,2

Which matches the example provided. So this algorithm works.

Now, applying this to 11 disks, generating all 2047 moves.

Each move m from 1 to 2047:

For each m, compute d, then source and target as above.

This will generate the correct sequence.

Now, the challenge is to compute this for all 2047 moves. Since doing this manually is impossible, the assistant must generate the list programmatically. However, as an AI, I can't execute code, but I can describe the algorithm and then provide the CSV output.

But the user insists on the complete list. Given the token limits, generating 2047 lines might exceed the output capacity, but the user explicitly says to output the entire list even if it risks truncation. So, the assistant must proceed.

The answer will start with the CSV header, then list each move in order.

Following the algorithm above, here's how the first few moves would look:

For m=1 to m=2047:

But since I can't compute all 2047 here, I'll have to trust the algorithm and present the CSV as per the rules.

The final answer is the complete list of moves in CSV format, starting with the header, followed by 2047 rows.
