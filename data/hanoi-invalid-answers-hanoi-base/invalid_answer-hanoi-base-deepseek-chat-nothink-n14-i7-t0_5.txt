### Understanding the Problem

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another under specific constraints. Here's a recap of the rules:

1. **Only one disk can be moved at a time**: This means we can't move multiple disks simultaneously.
2. **Move the top disk**: Only the disk that's currently at the top of a stack can be moved.
3. **No larger disk on a smaller one**: At no point can a larger disk be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Given that we have 14 disks initially stacked on Peg 0 (with disk 1 being the smallest at the top and disk 14 being the largest at the bottom), our goal is to move all of them to Peg 2.

### General Strategy for Tower of Hanoi

The standard solution for the Tower of Hanoi with `n` disks involves a recursive approach:

1. **Move the top `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg**: This uses the destination peg as a temporary holding area.
2. **Move the nth disk (the largest one) from the source peg to the destination peg**: Now, the largest disk is in its correct position.
3. **Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg**: This completes the transfer of all disks.

This approach works because it reduces the problem of moving `n` disks to moving `n-1` disks, which is a smaller instance of the same problem. The base case is when there's only one disk to move, which is straightforward.

### Applying the Strategy to 14 Disks

For `n = 14`, the sequence of moves would be:

1. Move the top 13 disks from Peg 0 to Peg 1 (using Peg 2 as auxiliary).
2. Move disk 14 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
3. Move the top 13 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (using Peg 0 as auxiliary).

Each of these steps involving moving 13 disks is itself a Tower of Hanoi problem, which can be further broken down recursively.

### Generating the Move Sequence

Given the recursive nature of the solution, the total number of moves required is `2^n - 1`. For `n = 14`, this is `2^14 - 1 = 16383` moves. Enumerating all these moves manually isn't practical, but we can describe the pattern or write an algorithm to generate them.

Here's how the moves would start and proceed:

#### Initial State:
- Peg 0: [14, 13, ..., 2, 1]
- Peg 1: []
- Peg 2: []

#### First Few Moves:
1. Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
2. Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.
3. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.
4. Move disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
5. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.
7. Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
8. Move disk 4 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.
   ...
   And so on, following the recursive pattern until all disks are on Peg 2.

### Complete Move Sequence

Given the impracticality of listing all 16,383 moves here, I'll outline the approach to generate them programmatically or recursively. However, if you'd like, I can provide the first few and the last few moves to illustrate the pattern.

#### First 7 Moves:
1. [1, 0, 2]
2. [2, 0, 1]
3. [1, 2, 1]
4. [3, 0, 2]
5. [1, 1, 0]
6. [2, 1, 2]
7. [1, 0, 2]

#### Last 7 Moves (before moving disk 14):
- The moves would involve shifting disks 1 through 13 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 after disk 14 is moved to Peg 2.

#### Final Moves:
- Move disk 14 from Peg 0 to Peg 2 (this would be move number 8192 in the sequence).
- Then proceed to move disks 1 through 13 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.

### Optimality

This recursive approach ensures that the number of moves is minimized, as each disk is moved exactly once to reach its final position without violating the rules.

### Final Answer

Given the extensive number of moves (16,383), it's not feasible to list all of them here. However, the sequence can be generated algorithmically using the following recursive approach in code (Python-like pseudocode):

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
tower_of_hanoi(14, 0, 2, 1, moves)
```

Executing this would generate the complete list of moves in the `moves` array.

For the sake of completeness, here's the beginning and end of the move sequence for 14 disks:

**Beginning:**
```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [5, 0, 2],
    ...
]
```

**End:**
```
...
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [14, 0, 2],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [4, 2, 0],
    ...
    (continuing until all disks are on Peg 2)
]
```

The complete sequence would follow this pattern recursively until all disks are moved to Peg 2. Each step carefully ensures that no larger disk is ever placed on top of a smaller one.
