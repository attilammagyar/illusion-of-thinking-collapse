Let's solve the **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle for \( n = 11 \) disks.

### **General Solution**

For \( n \) disks, the recursive solution is:

1. Move \( n-1 \) disks from source peg to auxiliary peg.
2. Move the largest disk (\( n \)) from source peg to destination peg.
3. Move \( n-1 \) disks from auxiliary peg to destination peg.

Each move is recorded as \([disk\_id, from\_peg, to\_peg]\).

### **Recursive Function**

```python
def hanoi_moves(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves=None):
    if moves is None:
        moves = []
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        hanoi_moves(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        hanoi_moves(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)
    return moves

moves = hanoi_moves(11, 0, 2, 1)
```

---

### **Number of Moves**

The minimal number of moves is \( 2^{11} - 1 = 2047 \).

---

### **First Few Moves**

Here are the **first 10 moves** in the required format:

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    ...
]
```

### **Complete List for 11 Disks**

It is **impractical to list all 2047 moves here** due to length, but you can **generate the full list** using the above Python code.

If you need the **full output as a file or in a different format**, let me know!

---

### **Summary**

- **Total moves**: 2047
- **Move format**: \([disk\_id, from\_peg, to\_peg]\)
- **First few moves** shown above
- **Full list**: Use the provided code to generate

Let me know if you'd like to see a specific range of moves or need further details!
