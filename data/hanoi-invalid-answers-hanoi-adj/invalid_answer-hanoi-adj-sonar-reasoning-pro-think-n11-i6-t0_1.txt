Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 11 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the standard rules. Since it's 11 disks, I know the minimum number of moves required is 2^11 - 1, which is 2047 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list without truncation.

First, I need to recall the recursive solution for Tower of Hanoi. The standard approach is: to move n disks from source to target, you first move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary, then move the nth disk from source to target, and finally move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to target. This recursive method ensures the optimal number of moves.

But generating the actual move list for 11 disks manually isn't feasible. However, there's a pattern or an iterative approach that can be used. I remember that the smallest disk (disk 1) moves every alternate move. The direction of movement depends on whether the number of disks is even or odd. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern, and for odd, another. Since 11 is odd, the smallest disk will move between pegs in a certain order.

Wait, let me confirm. For an odd number of disks, the smallest disk cycles through pegs 0 → 2 → 1 → 0..., and for even, it's 0 → 1 → 2 → 0... So with 11 disks (odd), the first move of disk 1 is from 0 to 2. Then the next non-disk-1 move is determined by the next smallest available disk.

Alternatively, there's a binary representation method where each move corresponds to a binary counter, but I'm not sure about the exact mapping. Maybe it's easier to stick with the recursive approach and simulate the moves.

But generating 2047 moves step by step would require a systematic way. Let's think about how the recursive algorithm would generate the moves. For each disk, the moves follow a certain pattern. For example, for 3 disks, the moves are:

1 from 0 to 2
2 from 0 to 1
1 from 2 to 1
3 from 0 to 2
1 from 1 to 0
2 from 1 to 2
1 from 0 to 2

Which totals 7 moves. For each additional disk, the number of moves doubles plus one. So for 11 disks, it's 2^11 -1 = 2047 moves.

The challenge is to generate each move correctly, ensuring that each move follows the rules. The recursive approach would involve breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. However, implementing recursion here isn't feasible manually, but perhaps there's a pattern or formula to determine each move's disk, source, and target.

Another approach is the iterative method, which involves the following steps:

1. Do the following until all disks are on the target peg:
   a. Move the smallest disk (disk 1) to the next peg in the cycle (direction depends on even/odd disks).
   b. Make the only valid move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

Since there are 11 disks (odd), the cycle for the smallest disk is 0 → 2 → 1 → 0...

So the first move is disk 1 from 0 to 2. Then, the next move is the smallest possible disk that's not 1, which would be disk 2. But wait, after moving disk 1, the next move must involve moving another disk. The rule is that after moving the smallest disk, the next move is the only possible legal move that doesn't involve the smallest disk. So after moving disk 1 to 2, the next move is to move the next smallest available disk (which is disk 2) from its current peg (still peg 0) to the only possible peg that's not peg 2 (since disk 1 is there). So peg 1 is empty, so disk 2 can move to peg 1. Then, move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1, and so on.

This iterative approach alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only other possible move. This should generate the correct sequence.

But how to translate this into a list of moves for 11 disks? It's going to be a long list, but perhaps there's a pattern or a way to generate each move step by step.

Alternatively, using the recursive approach, each move can be determined by the recursive steps. For example, moving 11 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1 as auxiliary:

- Move 10 disks from 0 to 1 using 2 as auxiliary.
- Move disk 11 from 0 to 2.
- Move 10 disks from 1 to 2 using 0 as auxiliary.

Each of those 10-disk moves would themselves be broken down into moving 9 disks, etc., down to the base case.

But generating this list programmatically would require a stack-based approach, but since I have to do it manually here, I need a different strategy.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to represent each move's disk number, source, and target based on the binary representation of the move number. For example, each move corresponds to a bit in binary, and the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move number. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, the sequence of disk moves follows a pattern where each disk moves in a cycle. For example, disk 1 moves every 2 moves, disk 2 every 4 moves, disk 3 every 8 moves, etc. The direction of each disk's movement depends on its position in the hierarchy.

But given the time constraints and the need to generate 2047 moves, it's impractical to write each step manually. However, the user insists on the complete list, so I must find a way to output it correctly.

Wait, perhaps there's a known iterative algorithm that can generate the moves. Let me recall:

In the iterative approach, for each move from 1 to 2^n -1:

1. Find the disk to move by counting the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move number. The disk number is the position of the rightmost 1-bit plus one.
2. Determine the direction to move the disk. For even-numbered disks, move clockwise; for odd, counter-clockwise (or vice versa, depending on the total number of disks).

But since the total number of disks is 11 (odd), the direction might be different. Let me check.

In the standard Tower of Hanoi, the direction of movement for the smallest disk depends on whether the total number of disks is even or odd. For an odd number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a cycle of 0 → 2 → 1 → 0..., and for even, 0 → 1 → 2 → 0...

So for 11 disks (odd), the smallest disk moves 0 → 2 → 1 → 0...

Each subsequent disk's movement is determined by the available pegs. The key is to alternate between moving the smallest disk and the next possible disk.

But how to translate this into a list of moves for 11 disks? It's going to require a loop that generates each move step by step, keeping track of the state of each peg.

Alternatively, since the problem is about generating the sequence programmatically, perhaps there's a formula or a pattern that can be followed to list all 2047 moves.

Another approach is to use the fact that each disk's moves follow a specific pattern. For example, disk 1 moves every 2 moves, disk 2 every 4 moves, disk 3 every 8 moves, etc. The direction of each disk's move alternates based on its own parity and the total number of disks.

But given the time, I need to find a way to generate the correct sequence. Let's consider the recursive approach again. For 11 disks, the sequence would be:

- Move disks 1-10 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary). This takes 2^10 -1 = 1023 moves.
- Move disk 11 from peg 0 to peg 2. (1 move)
- Move disks 1-10 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary). Another 1023 moves. Total 2047.

So the moves would be the sequence for moving 10 disks from 0→1, then disk 11 to 2, then 10 disks from 1→2.

Each of those 10-disk moves would themselves be broken down into moving 9 disks, etc. So the entire sequence is a recursive expansion.

But to generate the exact list, I need to simulate this recursion. However, doing this manually is impossible. Therefore, I must rely on the known optimal solution and output the sequence accordingly.

But how to represent this? The user wants the list in the format moves=[[disk_id, from_peg, to_peg], ...]. Each move must be correctly ordered.

Given that the optimal solution is well-known and the number of moves is 2047, perhaps there's a pattern or a way to generate each move's parameters based on the move number.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that the Tower of Hanoi problem has a known solution where each move can be determined by the binary representation of the move number. For each move number m (starting from 1), the disk to move is the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of m plus 1. The direction is determined by the disk's parity and the total number of disks.

For example, for move m=1 (binary 1), trailing zeros=0 → disk 1. Move it from 0 to 2 (since total disks is odd). Then m=2 (10), trailing zeros=1 → disk 2. The direction for disk 2 would depend on the rules. Wait, this might get complicated.

Alternatively, the source and target pegs can be determined using the following method:

For each move of disk k (where k is determined by the number of trailing zeros in m's binary representation plus 1):

- If k is odd, the direction is determined by the total number of disks. For odd total disks (11), the direction is 0→2→1→0...
- If k is even, the direction is the opposite.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

In the standard solution, the direction of movement for each disk depends on whether the disk number is even or odd. For example, disk 1 (smallest) moves in a cycle, and each subsequent disk moves in the opposite direction. But this might vary based on the total number of disks.

Alternatively, the direction can be determined by the following rule: for an odd number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a cycle 0→2→1→0..., and each even-numbered disk moves in the opposite direction. For even total disks, the smallest moves 0→1→2→0...

But I'm getting confused. Let's look for a pattern with smaller numbers.

For 1 disk (n=1, odd):

Move 1 from 0→2. Total moves:1.

For n=2 (even):

Move 1 from 0→1

Move 2 from 0→2

Move 1 from 1→2

Total moves:3.

For n=3 (odd):

Move 1 from 0→2

Move 2 from 0→1

Move 1 from 2→1

Move 3 from 0→2

Move 1 from 1→0

Move 2 from 1→2

Move 1 from 0→2

Total moves:7.

So for n=3 (odd), the smallest disk moves 0→2→1→0→2→1→0→2. Wait, in the sequence above, the moves for disk 1 are 0→2, then 2→1, then 1→0, then 0→2. So the direction alternates between moving to the next peg in the cycle 0→2→1→0...

So for odd n, the smallest disk cycles 0→2→1→0...

For even n, it cycles 0→1→2→0...

Each larger disk moves in the opposite direction. For example, disk 2 in n=3 (odd) moves from 0→1, then later from 1→2. So its direction is 0→1→2, which is the same as the smallest disk's cycle for even n. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, each disk's movement direction is determined by its own parity. For example, disk 1 (odd) moves in one direction, disk 2 (even) in the opposite.

But perhaps the key is that for each disk, the direction alternates based on the disk's number. For example, odd-numbered disks move in one direction, even in another.

But given the complexity, perhaps the safest way is to use the recursive approach to generate the moves.

Let's try to outline the recursive steps for n=11.

The recursive function would be:

def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}")
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}")
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

Applying this to n=11, source=0, target=2, auxiliary=1.

The sequence would be:

1. Move disks 1-10 from 0→1 using 2 as auxiliary.
2. Move disk 11 from 0→2.
3. Move disks 1-10 from 1→2 using 0 as auxiliary.

Each of the steps 1 and 3 involve moving 10 disks, which themselves break down into moving 9 disks, etc.

But generating the exact list of moves for 11 disks would require expanding this recursion fully. Since it's impossible to do manually, I need to find a pattern or a way to represent the moves programmatically.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that the sequence of moves follows a specific pattern where each disk's moves are interleaved with smaller disks. For example, the largest disk moves only once (from 0→2), the second largest moves twice, etc.

But again, generating the exact list is challenging. However, the user insists on the complete list, so I must provide it.

Given that the optimal solution for 11 disks requires 2047 moves, and each move can be determined by the recursive approach, the correct answer is the sequence generated by the standard Tower of Hanoi algorithm.

Therefore, the moves list will be the complete sequence generated by the recursive algorithm, which for 11 disks is 2047 moves long. Each move can be determined by following the recursive steps, but since I can't compute each move manually here, I must rely on the known solution.

However, the user expects the assistant to output the full list. Since the assistant can't generate 2047 moves manually, perhaps there's a pattern or a way to output the list programmatically. But within the constraints of this exercise, the assistant must provide the correct sequence.

Wait, perhaps the assistant can generate the list using a formula. Each move can be determined by the binary representation of the move number. For example, for each move number m (from 1 to 2^11 -1), the disk to move is the number of trailing zeros in m's binary representation plus 1. The direction is determined by the disk's parity and the total number of disks.

Let's test this with n=3 (moves 1-7):

Move 1: binary 1 (trailing zeros=0) → disk 1. Direction for disk 1 (odd) in n=3 (odd) is 0→2.

Move 2: binary 10 (trailing zeros=1) → disk 2. Direction for disk 2 (even) in n=3 (odd) would be opposite to disk 1's direction. Since disk 1 moves 0→2→1..., disk 2 moves 0→1→2...

So move 2: disk 2 from 0→1.

Move 3: binary 11 (trailing zeros=0) → disk 1. Move from 2→1.

Move 4: binary 100 (trailing zeros=2) → disk 3. Direction for disk 3 (odd) same as disk 1: 0→2. So move disk 3 from 0→2.

Move 5: binary 101 (trailing zeros=0) → disk 1. Move from 1→0.

Move 6: binary 110 (trailing zeros=1) → disk 2. Move from 1→2.

Move 7: binary 111 (trailing zeros=0) → disk 1. Move from 0→2.

This matches the example provided in the user's query. So this method works.

Therefore, the formula is:

For each move m from 1 to 2^n -1:

1. Find the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of m. Let k = number of trailing zeros + 1. This is the disk to move.

2. Determine the direction of the move for disk k:

   - If k is odd, the direction depends on the total number of disks n. If n is odd, the direction is a cycle of 0→2→1→0... For each move of disk k, the direction alternates between these pegs.

   - If k is even, the direction is the opposite cycle (0→1→2→0... for odd n).

But how to determine the source and target pegs for each disk k at each move?

Alternatively, the source and target pegs can be determined using the following steps:

- For disk k, the number of moves it makes is 2^(k-1). The first move is from the source peg to the target peg, then the next moves alternate between auxiliary and target, etc.

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed. For each disk k, the moves alternate between two pegs. For example, disk 1 moves every other move, alternating between pegs. Disk 2 moves every four moves, etc.

But given the complexity, perhaps the best way is to implement the iterative algorithm based on the binary representation.

Here's the iterative algorithm steps:

1. Initialize three pegs, with all disks on peg 0.

2. For each move m from 1 to 2^n -1:

   a. Determine the disk to move: k = number of trailing zeros in binary(m) + 1.

   b. Determine the direction to move the disk:

      - If n is odd:

         - For disk k:

            - If k is odd: move in the cycle 0→2→1→0...

            - If k is even: move in the cycle 0→1→2→0...

      - If n is even:

         - For disk k:

            - If k is odd: move in the cycle 0→1→2→0...

            - If k is even: move in the cycle 0→2→1→0...

      But I'm not sure if this is accurate. Let's test with n=3 (odd):

      For disk 1 (odd), direction is 0→2→1→0...

      For disk 2 (even), direction is 0→1→2→0...

      For disk 3 (odd), direction is 0→2→1→0...

      Which matches the example.

      So for n=11 (odd), the direction rules are:

      - Odd k: cycle 0→2→1→0...

      - Even k: cycle 0→1→2→0...

   c. Find the current peg of disk k. Since we can't track the state, we need another way. Alternatively, the move direction alternates based on the number of times the disk has been moved.

      Each disk k moves 2^(k-1) times. The first move is from source to target, then the next moves alternate between auxiliary and target.

      Wait, perhaps for each disk k, the moves alternate between two pegs. For example, disk 1 moves between peg 0 and 2, then 2 and 1, etc., depending on the direction.

      This is getting too complicated. Maybe the best approach is to use the formula that for each move m, the source and target pegs can be determined using the following method:

      For disk k (determined by trailing zeros in m):

      - The source peg is the current peg of disk k.

      - The target peg is determined by the direction cycle.

      But without tracking the state, it's impossible to know the current peg. Therefore, this approach might not be feasible.

      Alternatively, there's a mathematical formula to determine the source and target pegs based on the move number and disk number.

      According to some sources, the source and target pegs for each move can be determined using the following steps:

      1. For move m, convert m to binary.

      2. The number of trailing zeros gives the disk number minus 1.

      3. The parity of the disk number determines the direction.

      4. For odd total disks (n=11):

         - If the disk number is odd, the move direction is 0→2→1→0...

         - If even, 0→1→2→0...

      5. The step number for the disk determines which move in the cycle it is. For example, disk k moves every 2^(k) moves.

      But I'm not sure. Let's try with n=3, move 1 (binary 1, trailing zeros=0 → disk 1, odd):

         Direction cycle: 0→2→1→0...

         First move: 0→2.

      Move 2 (binary 10, trailing zeros=1 → disk 2, even):

         Direction cycle: 0→1→2→0...

         First move: 0→1.

      Move 3 (binary 11, trailing zeros=0 → disk 1, odd):

         Next in cycle: 2→1.

      Move 4 (binary 100, trailing zeros=2 → disk 3, odd):

         Direction cycle: 0→2→1→0...

         First move: 0→2.

      Move 5 (binary 101, trailing zeros=0 → disk 1, odd):

         Next in cycle: 1→0.

      Move 6 (binary 110, trailing zeros=1 → disk 2, even):

         Next in cycle: 1→2.

      Move 7 (binary 111, trailing zeros=0 → disk 1, odd):

         Next in cycle: 0→2.

      This matches the example, so the formula works.

      Therefore, for n=11 (odd), the rules are:

      - For each move m:

         a. k = number of trailing zeros in binary(m) + 1.

         b. If k is odd: direction cycle is 0→2→1→0...

         c. If k is even: direction cycle is 0→1→2→0...

         d. The number of times disk k has been moved before is (m / 2^(k-1)) - 1. Wait, perhaps the step in the cycle is determined by (m / 2^(k)) mod 3.

         Alternatively, the direction for each move of disk k alternates between two pegs. For example, disk 1 moves 0→2→1→0..., which is a cycle of 3 pegs. But each subsequent move of disk k alternates between the two possible pegs that are not the current one.

         This is getting too complex. Perhaps the correct approach is to note that for each disk k, the moves alternate between two pegs, and the initial direction depends on the parity of k and n.

         Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to generate the moves using the iterative method based on the binary representation and the direction rules.

         For each move m from 1 to 2047:

         1. Determine k = number of trailing zeros in m's binary + 1.

         2. Determine the direction cycle for k:

             - If k is odd: cycle is 0→2→1→0...

             - If k is even: cycle is 0→1→2→0...

         3. Determine the current position of disk k. Since we can't track state, we need to calculate it based on the number of times it has been moved before.

             The number of times disk k has been moved before is floor((m - 1) / 2^k). For example, for disk 1 (k=1), each move is every 2 moves. For disk 2 (k=2), every 4 moves, etc.

             The parity of this count (even or odd) determines the direction step.

             For example, if the count is even, move in the first direction of the cycle; if odd, the next.

             But this is getting too involved. Perhaps there's a simpler way.

             Alternatively, the source and target pegs can be determined using the following formula:

             For disk k:

             - The initial peg is 0.

             - The target peg is determined by the direction cycle.

             - For each move of disk k, it alternates between the two possible pegs based on the cycle.

             But without tracking the state, it's impossible to know the current peg. Therefore, this approach isn't feasible.

             Given that the user insists on the complete list and the assistant can't generate it manually, perhaps the correct answer is to output the list generated by the recursive algorithm, which is the standard solution.

             Therefore, the assistant should output the complete list of moves in the required format, even though it's 2047 entries long. However, due to token limitations, the assistant might truncate the output, but the user insists on not truncating. Therefore, the assistant must proceed to generate the list.

             Since it's impossible to write all 2047 moves here manually, the assistant must rely on the fact that the correct answer is the standard Tower of Hanoi solution for 11 disks, which follows the recursive pattern. Each move can be generated by simulating the recursive steps.

             However, given the constraints, the assistant will proceed to output the list in the required format, starting with the first few moves and continuing until the end, ensuring that all 2047 moves are present. But practically, due to token limits, the assistant might not be able to output all moves. However, the user insists, so the assistant must try.

             The correct sequence begins with moving disk 1 from 0 to 2, then disk 2 from 0 to 1, then disk 1 from 2 to 1, and so on, following the recursive pattern.

             Therefore, the final answer is the complete list of 2047 moves generated by the standard Tower of Hanoi algorithm for 11 disks, which can be represented as follows:
