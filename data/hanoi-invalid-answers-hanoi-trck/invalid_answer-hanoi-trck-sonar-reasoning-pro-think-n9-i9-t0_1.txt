Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 9 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's 9 disks, which is an odd number, I remember that the iterative solution involves moving the smallest disk in a consistent direction. For odd disks, the smallest disk moves to the right each time, cycling through pegs 0→2→1→0 and so on. But I need to make sure each move is correct.

First, the minimum number of moves is 2^9 - 1 = 511. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list. Let me recall the standard iterative approach. Each step alternates between moving the smallest disk and making the only possible move with a non-smallest disk. Since the number of disks is odd, the smallest disk (1) should move in a clockwise direction (0→2, 2→1, 1→0, etc.).

Wait, the iterative solution steps are: move the smallest disk, then make the only other possible move. Repeat until done. For each move, after moving the smallest, the next move has to be between the two other pegs, whichever is legal. Let me verify with the example given in the search results. The example with 3 disks had 7 moves, which matches 2^3 -1. The solution there alternated between moving disk 1 and the other disks.

But generating all 511 moves manually is impossible. However, the user provided some search results. Let me check them. The first result [1] is a video showing a 9-disk solution in 511 moves. The third result [3] mentions an algorithm for moving disks, focusing on the top three disks and alternating moves. The Wikipedia entry [5] confirms the iterative solution, alternating moves between the smallest and non-smallest disks.

So the plan is to follow the iterative algorithm. For each step, move the smallest disk (1) in the correct direction (since 9 is odd, direction is right: 0→2→1→0...). Then make the only possible move between the other two pegs. Repeat this until all disks are on peg 2.

But how to translate this into the exact sequence of moves? Let's start with the initial state:

Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
Peg1: empty
Peg2: empty

Move 1: Move disk 1 from peg0 to peg2. Now peg0 has 9-2, peg2 has 1.

Move 2: Now, the non-smallest move. The possible moves are between peg0 and peg1. The top disks are 2 on peg0 and nothing elsewhere. So move disk 2 from peg0 to peg1.

Move 3: Move disk 1 from peg2 to peg1. Now peg1 has 2 1.

Move 4: Next non-smallest move. Move disk 3 from peg0 to peg2.

Move 5: Move disk 1 from peg1 to peg0.

Move 6: Move disk 2 from peg1 to peg2.

Move 7: Move disk 1 from peg0 to peg2.

This pattern continues, but keeping track of all 511 moves is tedious. However, the user insists on the full list. Since the solution is recursive, but the iterative approach is more straightforward here.

Alternatively, the recursive approach for Tower of Hanoi is: to move n disks from A to C, move n-1 disks from A to B, then move the nth disk from A to C, then move n-1 disks from B to C. But for 9 disks, this would generate the correct sequence, but the exact move list needs to be generated step by step.

But given the user's note, they want the raw list without explanation. The challenge is to generate all 511 moves correctly. Since manually writing them is impossible, perhaps there's a pattern or a way to represent the moves algorithmically. However, the user requires the explicit list.

Looking at the example provided in the query, for 3 disks, the solution has 7 moves. Each move alternates between moving disk 1 and another disk. The pattern for 3 disks is:

1. Move 1 from 0→2
2. Move 2 from 0→1
3. Move 1 from 2→1
4. Move 3 from 0→2
5. Move 1 from 1→0
6. Move 2 from 1→2
7. Move 1 from 0→2

This follows the iterative approach. For 9 disks, the same pattern applies but with more layers. Each time a larger disk is moved, the smaller disks are shuffled between the other pegs.

But generating all 511 moves here would require following this pattern precisely. Since the user provided a video [1] showing the solution, perhaps the moves can be derived from that, but the transcript doesn't list each move. The search result [3] mentions an algorithm where you alternate moving disk 1 and the next available disk.

Given that the minimum moves are 511, and the example for 3 disks follows the iterative method, I'll proceed to generate the moves step by step following the iterative algorithm.

However, given the length, I need to ensure that each move is correctly recorded with the peg states. This will be a long list, but the user insists on no truncation. Let's start generating the moves systematically.

The iterative algorithm steps:

1. For each move, if it's an odd-numbered move (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.), move the smallest disk (1) in the prescribed direction (for odd n, direction is right: 0→2→1→0...).
2. If it's an even-numbered move, make the only possible move between the two pegs that don't involve the smallest disk.

Let's begin:

Move 1: Move disk 1 from peg0 to peg2. Peg0: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2; Peg2: 1.

Move 2: Move the next possible non-smallest disk. The top of peg0 is 2, and peg1 is empty. So move disk 2 from peg0 to peg1.

Move 3: Move disk 1 from peg2 to peg1. Now peg1 has 2 1.

Move 4: Move the next non-smallest disk. The top of peg0 is 3. The only legal move is to peg2 (since peg2 has 1, which is smaller than 3). Wait, peg2 is empty after move 3? Wait, after move 3, peg2 is empty because disk 1 moved to peg1. Wait no: move 3 is moving disk 1 from peg2 (which had disk 1 after move 1) to peg1. So after move 3, peg2 is empty. So peg0 has 9 8 7 6 5 4 3; peg1 has 2 1; peg2 is empty.

So move 4: Move disk 3 from peg0 to peg2.

Move 5: Move disk 1 from peg1 to peg0.

Move 6: Move disk 2 from peg1 to peg2.

Move 7: Move disk 1 from peg0 to peg2.

Move 8: Move disk 4 from peg0 to peg1.

Move 9: Move disk 1 from peg2 to peg1.

Move 10: Move disk 2 from peg2 to peg0.

Move 11: Move disk 1 from peg1 to peg0.

Move 12: Move disk 3 from peg2 to peg1.

Move 13: Move disk 1 from peg0 to peg2.

Move 14: Move disk 2 from peg0 to peg1.

Move 15: Move disk 1 from peg2 to peg1.

Move 16: Move disk 4 from peg1 to peg0.

... This pattern continues, but it's clear that manually listing all 511 moves is impractical. However, the user requires the complete list. Given that the search results mention that the minimum number of moves is 2^9 -1 = 511, and the example for 3 disks follows the iterative approach, the correct answer must be the sequence generated by the iterative algorithm.

Since I can't generate all 511 moves here manually, I need to rely on the fact that the iterative algorithm produces the correct sequence. The key is to ensure that each move follows the rules and that the peg states are correctly updated after each move.

Therefore, the final answer will be the complete list of 511 moves generated by the iterative algorithm, adhering to the specified format. Each move_id increments by 1, and the from_peg and to_peg follow the algorithm's steps. The peg states are updated accordingly after each move.
