Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 14 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves in CSV format without any explanation. First, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive problem. The minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, so for 14 disks, that's 2^14 - 1 = 16383 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

The iterative solution might be the way to go here since generating a recursive solution's moves could be complex. From the search results, the iterative approach alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Since 14 is even, the initial direction for the smallest disk (disk 1) should be to the right, i.e., from peg 0 to peg 1, then peg 1 to peg 2, and so on.

Wait, the Wikipedia article mentions that for an even number of disks, the stack ends up on peg C (which is peg 2 in this case), which matches the goal here. The iterative solution steps are: alternate moving the smallest disk and the only possible legal move with another disk. Each time you move the smallest disk, you alternate direction based on the parity of the number of disks. Since 14 is even, the direction is to the right.

So the algorithm would be:
1. Move the smallest disk (disk 1) to the next peg in the direction (right). So from 0→1→2→0...
2. Then make the only legal move possible that doesn't involve the smallest disk.
3. Repeat until all disks are on peg 2.

But how to translate this into a sequence of moves for 14 disks? Manually generating this would be error-prone. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to generate the moves systematically.

Looking at the example for 3 disks in the search results, the moves are:
1,0,2
2,0,1
1,2,1
3,0,2
1,1,0
2,1,2
1,0,2

This follows the recursive approach: move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary, move the nth disk to target, then move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target. But for 14 disks, the recursive method would require a lot of steps, and generating the list programmatically would be better. However, since I can't write code here, I need to find a pattern or use the iterative approach's rules.

The iterative solution's steps from Wikipedia: alternate between moving the smallest disk and the only possible non-smallest disk. For even n, the smallest disk moves right (0→1→2→0...), for odd n, left. Since 14 is even, disk 1 moves right each time.

Each move of the smallest disk is followed by the only possible move of another disk. For example, after moving disk 1 to peg 1, the next move must be the smallest possible disk that's not 1, which would be disk 2, but only if it's legal. Wait, no—the non-smallest move is the only legal move possible between the other two pegs, not involving the smallest disk.

This process repeats until all disks are moved. The challenge is to generate all 16383 moves correctly. Since manually listing them is impossible, I need to rely on the algorithm's pattern.

Alternatively, the recursive approach can be used to generate the moves. The recursive function for moving n disks from source to target using auxiliary is:
- Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.
- Move the nth disk from source to target.
- Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target.

Applying this recursively for each disk. For 14 disks, this would involve breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. Each time, the source, target, and auxiliary pegs switch roles based on the current subproblem.

But how to translate this into the actual sequence of moves? Let's consider the base case. For 1 disk, move it from source to target. For 2 disks, move disk 1 to auxiliary, disk 2 to target, then disk 1 to target. For 3 disks, it's the example given. The pattern here is that each odd-numbered move involves moving the smallest disk, alternating directions based on the total number of disks.

Given that the user needs the full list, and the iterative approach can be systematically applied, perhaps the best way is to follow the iterative algorithm's steps:

1. Initialize the direction for the smallest disk (right since n=14 is even).
2. While not all disks are on peg 2:
   a. Move the smallest disk in the current direction.
   b. Make the only legal move possible with the remaining disks.
   c. Alternate the direction for the next smallest disk move.

But implementing this step-by-step for 14 disks would require tracking each move, which is complex. However, the search results mention that the iterative solution can be broken down into repeating a sequence of three moves. For example, the Wikipedia article states the iterative solution involves repeating three steps: moving between A and B, A and C, B and C, whichever is legal.

Wait, the Wikipedia article's iterative solution says:

- Move one disk from peg A to peg B or vice versa, whichever move is legal.
- Move one disk from peg A to peg C or vice versa, whichever move is legal.
- Move one disk from peg B to peg C or vice versa, whichever move is legal.

But this seems a bit unclear. Alternatively, the article mentions that for the iterative solution, you alternate between moving the smallest disk and the only possible non-smallest move. Each time you move the smallest disk, you move it in the direction determined by the parity of the number of disks. For even n, direction is right (0→1→2→0...), for odd, left (0→2→1→0...).

So, the algorithm would be:

For each move:
1. If it's an odd-numbered move (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...), move the smallest disk (disk 1) in the current direction.
2. If it's an even-numbered move, make the only possible legal move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

This repeats until all disks are moved. Since the total moves are 2^14 -1 = 16383, which is an odd number, the last move will be moving the smallest disk.

But how to determine the direction each time the smallest disk is moved? For even n, the initial direction is right. Each time the smallest disk is moved, it alternates direction? Or continues in the same direction? Wait, the Wikipedia article says: "When moving the smallest piece, always move it to the next position in the same direction (to the right if the starting number of pieces is even, to the left if the starting number of pieces is odd). If there is no tower position in the chosen direction, move the piece to the opposite end, but then continue to move in the correct direction."

So for n=14 (even), the direction is right. So each time you move the smallest disk, you move it to the next peg to the right. If that's not possible (e.g., at peg 2, next right would be peg 0), then wrap around.

So the sequence for disk 1 would be: 0→1→2→0→1→2... etc.

Between each move of disk 1, there's a move of another disk, which is the only legal move available that doesn't involve disk 1.

This seems manageable. Let's try to outline the first few moves for n=3 to see the pattern:

n=3 (odd), direction is left.

Move 1: disk 1 from 0→2 (left direction)
Move 2: disk 2 from 0→1 (only legal move)
Move 3: disk 1 from 2→1 (left direction would be 2→1)
Move 4: disk 3 from 0→2
Move 5: disk 1 from 1→0 (left direction from 1 is 0)
Move 6: disk 2 from 1→2
Move 7: disk 1 from 0→2

Which matches the example given. So for even n=14, the direction is right, so disk 1 moves 0→1→2→0→1... etc.

Now, applying this to n=14:

The first move is disk 1 from 0→1.

Then, the next move is the only legal move not involving disk 1. Since disk 1 is on peg 1, the other disks are on peg 0 (disks 2-14) and peg 2 (empty). The only possible move is disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (since peg 2 is empty and disk 2 is smaller than any disk there (none)).

Wait, but disk 2 is on top of disk 3, which is larger, so moving disk 2 to peg 2 is allowed.

So move 2: disk 2 from 0→2.

Move 3: disk 1 from 1→2 (next direction right: 1→2).

Now, disk 1 is on peg 2. The next non-disk1 move: the only legal move is disk 3 from 0→1 (since peg 1 is empty, and disk 3 can go there).

Move 4: disk 3 from 0→1.

Move 5: disk 1 from 2→0 (direction right: 2→0).

Move 6: disk 2 from 2→1 (since disk 2 is on peg 2, can it move to peg 1? Yes, because peg 1 has disk 3, which is larger. So disk 2 goes on top of disk 3.

Move 7: disk 1 from 0→1 (direction right: 0→1).

Move 8: disk 4 from 0→2 (the next available move for non-disk1).

This pattern continues, with disk 1 moving right each time, and the non-disk1 moves following the only legal option.

The challenge is to generate all 16383 moves correctly. Since doing this manually is impossible, I need to find a way to represent the algorithm's steps accurately.

However, given the constraints of this exercise, I need to output the complete list. But generating such a long list here isn't feasible due to token limits. Wait, but the user insists on the full list, even if it risks truncation. The note says that the first invalid move matters, so the more valid moves generated, the better.

But how can I generate the full list here? It's impossible to write out 16k moves manually. However, perhaps there's a pattern or a way to describe the algorithm that can be followed programmatically. But since I can't write code here, I need to find another approach.

Wait, the search result [5] mentions an algorithm for solving the Tower of Hanoi with an even number of disks. It says to use the "even" algorithm, which involves moving disk 1 to the left, but since the user has 14 disks (even), maybe the algorithm is slightly different. Wait, the quote from [5] says: "if your starting tower has an even number of disks you'll need to use the alternate 'Even' algorithm." The example in [5] for the odd algorithm involves moving disk 1 to the left, but for even, perhaps it's to the right.

The iterative solution from Wikipedia for even n: the smallest disk moves to the right each time. So the direction is consistent.

Given that, the moves follow a specific pattern where disk 1 alternates between pegs in a rightward direction, and the other moves are determined by the only legal option available.

But to generate the entire list, I need to simulate this process. However, without writing a program, it's impossible to list all 16383 moves here. But the user insists, so perhaps the answer expects the recognition that the number of moves is 2^14 -1 = 16383, and the iterative approach's steps, but given the constraints, maybe the assistant is supposed to provide the recursive solution's moves.

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can generate the moves using the recursive approach, breaking down the problem into moving 13 disks, then the 14th, then the 13 again. But again, without code, it's not feasible.

Wait, the user provided search results include a YouTube video [3] showing a 14-disk solution. However, the transcript isn't helpful. The other results explain the iterative and recursive methods.

Given that the user wants the complete list, and the assistant can't generate it manually, perhaps the correct approach is to output the CSV header followed by the first few and last few moves, indicating the pattern, but the user explicitly said not to truncate. However, the note says, "Do not truncate or summarize the moves. Output the entire move list in full, even if it is long. This is required for task success."

This is a dilemma. The assistant can't generate 16k lines here, but the user insists. However, in the context of this exercise, perhaps the expected answer is to recognize that the optimal solution requires 16383 moves and to provide them in the correct order, but given the impossibility, maybe the assistant is expected to provide a placeholder or explain it's too long. But the user said, "I don't need any explanation, just the raw and complete list of moves in the specified format."

This suggests that the assistant must provide the full list, even if it's truncated by the system. Therefore, the assistant should proceed to generate the list according to the iterative algorithm, knowing that it might be cut off but providing as much as possible.

But how to structure this? The iterative approach's moves can be determined by following the rules:

For each move:
- If the move number is odd, move disk 1 in the current direction (right for even n).
- If even, make the only legal move not involving disk 1.

Let's attempt to generate the first few moves and see the pattern.

Move 1 (odd): disk 1 from 0→1
Move 2 (even): move the only possible non-disk1 move. The pegs are:
- Peg 0: disks 2-14
- Peg 1: disk 1
- Peg 2: empty
The only legal move is disk 2 from 0→2 (since peg 2 is empty).

Move 3 (odd): disk 1 from 1→2
Move 4 (even): move the only possible non-disk1 move. Pegs:
- Peg 0: disks 3-14
- Peg 1: empty
- Peg 2: disks 1,2
The only legal move is disk 3 from 0→1 (since peg 1 is empty).

Move 5 (odd): disk 1 from 2→0 (right direction: 2→0)
Move 6 (even): move non-disk1. Pegs:
- Peg 0: disk 1, disks 4-14 (wait, no, after move 4, peg 0 has disks 3-14, peg 1 has disk 3, peg 2 has disks 1 and 2. After move 5, disk 1 is on peg 0, so peg 0 has disk 1 (top) and disks 3-14 (underneath). But disk 1 is on top, so the next move (move 6) must move a non-disk1 disk. The available disks are disk 2 on peg 2 and disk 3 on peg 1. The only legal move is disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1 (since disk 2 is smaller than disk 3).

Move 6: disk 2 from 2→1
Move 7 (odd): disk 1 from 0→1 (right direction: 0→1)
Move 8 (even): move non-disk1. Pegs:
- Peg 0: disks 3-14
- Peg 1: disk 1, disk 2, disk 3
- Peg 2: empty
The only legal move is disk 4 from peg 0→2.

Move 8: disk 4 from 0→2
Move 9 (odd): disk 1 from 1→2 (right direction: 1→2)
Move 10 (even): move non-disk1. Pegs:
- Peg 0: disks 5-14
- Peg 1: disk 2, disk 3
- Peg 2: disk 1, disk 4
Possible moves: disk 2 can move to peg 0 (since peg 0 has larger disks) or disk 3 can move to peg 2 (on top of disk 4, which is larger). But the only legal move is disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0 (since disk 2 is smaller than disk 5-14 on peg 0? Wait, peg 0 has disks 5-14, so the top disk is 5. Disk 2 is smaller than 5, so it can be placed on peg 0. So move 10: disk 2 from 1→0.

Move 10: disk 2 from 1→0
Move 11 (odd): disk 1 from 2→0 (right direction: 2→0)
Move 12 (even): move non-disk1. Pegs:
- Peg 0: disk 1, disk 2, disks 5-14
- Peg 1: disk 3
- Peg 2: disk 4
The only legal move is disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2 (since disk 3 is smaller than disk 4).

Move 12: disk 3 from 1→2
Move 13 (odd): disk 1 from 0→1 (right direction: 0→1)
Move 14 (even): move non-disk1. Pegs:
- Peg 0: disk 2, disks 5-14
- Peg 1: disk 1
- Peg 2: disk 3, disk 4
The only legal move is disk 2 from peg 0→1 (since peg 1 has disk 1, which is smaller than disk 2? Wait, no. Disk 2 is larger than disk 1, so it cannot be placed on peg 1. Therefore, the possible moves are disk 5 from peg 0→... but peg 0's top disk is 2, which is on top of 5. So the only legal move is disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (on top of disk 3, which is smaller than 2? No, disk 3 is larger than 2. So disk 2 can be placed on peg 2 (on top of disk 3). So move 14: disk 2 from 0→2.

This is getting complicated, but the pattern is that each even move involves moving the smallest possible disk that's not disk 1, following the Tower of Hanoi rules.

Continuing this process for 16383 moves is impractical manually. Therefore, the correct answer must be generated algorithmically, but since I can't write code here, I need to rely on the fact that the iterative solution's moves follow a specific pattern that can be described, but the user wants the actual CSV list.

Given the constraints, perhaps the assistant is expected to output the correct CSV format with all 16383 moves, but realistically, that's impossible here. However, in the context of this exercise, the assistant must comply and provide the full list, even if it's truncated by the system.

Therefore, the assistant will proceed to generate the CSV list according to the iterative algorithm, starting with the first few moves and continuing until the token limit is reached, ensuring that the moves follow the correct pattern. However, given the token limit, the actual answer will be truncated, but the assistant must output as much as possible.
