Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 10 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves in the specified format without any truncation. First, I remember that the minimum number of moves required for n disks is 2^n - 1. For 10 disks, that's 1023 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

The standard recursive solution involves moving the top n-1 disks from the source to the auxiliary peg, then moving the nth disk to the target peg, and finally moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary to the target. However, generating all those moves step-by-step manually would be time-consuming. But since the user provided some search results, maybe there's an iterative approach mentioned.

Looking at the search results, the iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and another disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern. Since 10 is even, the smallest disk (disk 1) should move cyclically between pegs. The iterative method might be more straightforward to implement here.

Wait, the example given in the query uses 3 disks and shows a specific move sequence. The solution for 3 disks takes 7 moves. The iterative approach for even n would involve moving the smallest disk in a circular manner (e.g., peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0, etc.), and for each non-smallest move, there's only one legal move. 

But generating all 1023 moves manually isn't feasible. However, the user provided a link to a video titled "Tower Of Hanoi 10 Discs Grand Solution" which might have the exact move sequence. Since the search results include that, perhaps the answer can be derived from there. But since I can't watch the video, I need to rely on the description and the formula.

Alternatively, the Wikipedia article mentions the iterative solution steps. The iterative approach for even n (like 10) would have the stack end up on peg C (peg 2 in this case), which matches the goal. So following the iterative method:

1. Move disk 1 (smallest) to the next peg in the direction (since n is even, direction is to the right: peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0...).
2. Make the only legal move not involving disk 1.
3. Repeat until all disks are on peg 2.

Each move of disk 1 alternates with a move of the next smallest possible disk. This pattern continues until completion. 

To generate the move list, I need to simulate each step. Starting with all disks on peg 0. The first move is disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (since n is even, direction is right). Then the next legal move without involving disk 1, which would be moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2. Then move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2. Then move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1. Then move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0, and so on. 

This pattern continues, but manually listing all 1023 moves is impractical. However, the user insists on the full list. Given the constraints, perhaps the answer expects the recognition that the number of moves is 1023 and the pattern follows the iterative approach, but actually listing all moves isn't feasible here. However, the problem might expect the assistant to generate the moves programmatically, but since I can't execute code, I need another approach.

Wait, the search result [2] is a video titled "Tower Of Hanoi 10 Discs Grand Solution" which likely shows the entire sequence. Since the user provided that, perhaps the answer is to follow that video's steps. But without access to the video content, I have to rely on the known algorithm.

Alternatively, the formula S = 2^N -1 gives 1023 moves for N=10. The assistant must output all 1023 moves in the specified format. However, generating each move step-by-step here is impossible due to length. But the user insists, so perhaps the answer is to acknowledge that the full list is too long but provide the initial and final moves, but the user explicitly said not to truncate. 

Wait, the example in the query shows a 3-disk solution with 7 moves. For 10 disks, the assistant must generate all 1023 moves. But given token limits, it's impossible to output all here. However, the problem might be a test to see if the assistant can follow the format correctly for a few moves and then acknowledge the rest, but the user insists on no truncation. 

This is a contradiction. The assistant must output the full list, but it's impossible due to token constraints. However, the problem states that it's a benchmark test where the first invalid move matters. So perhaps the assistant should generate as many correct moves as possible, following the iterative approach, and continue until the output is cut off, but the user will have to accept that. 

Alternatively, the assistant can generate the correct sequence programmatically, but since I can't run code, I have to describe the pattern. However, the user wants the raw list. 

Given the constraints, the correct approach is to outline the iterative solution's pattern and provide the initial moves, then note that the pattern continues for all 1023 moves. But the user explicitly said not to truncate. 

This is a dilemma. However, the problem might expect the assistant to provide the full list in the specified format, even if it's extremely long. Since the user insists, the assistant must comply. 

But how? Manually writing 1023 moves isn't feasible. However, perhaps the assistant can generate the moves using the iterative algorithm's steps and output them in the correct format. 

The iterative algorithm for even n (10) is as follows:

- The smallest disk moves in a cyclic manner to the right (peg 0 → 1 → 2 → 0...).
- After each move of the smallest disk, make the only possible move that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

This alternation continues until all disks are moved. 

Let's attempt to generate the first few moves to illustrate the pattern:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 1
2. Move 2 from 0 to 2
3. Move 1 from 1 to 2
4. Move 3 from 0 to 1
5. Move 1 from 2 to 0
6. Move 2 from 2 to 1
7. Move 1 from 0 to 1
8. Move 4 from 0 to 2
9. Move 1 from 1 to 2
10. Move 2 from 1 to 0
11. Move 1 from 2 to 0
12. Move 3 from 1 to 2
13. Move 1 from 0 to 1
14. Move 2 from 0 to 2
15. Move 1 from 1 to 2
16. Move 5 from 0 to 1
...

This pattern continues, with each even step moving the smallest disk and odd steps moving the next available disk. However, generating all 1023 moves in this format is beyond practical manual entry. 

Given the problem's constraints, the assistant must output the complete list. Since the user provided a link to a 10-disk solution video, perhaps the correct answer is to direct the user to that resource. However, the query insists on the raw list. 

In conclusion, the assistant must generate the full list of 1023 moves following the iterative pattern. However, due to token limitations, it's impossible to provide all here. But the problem might expect the assistant to proceed as far as possible, adhering strictly to the format. Therefore, the assistant will start generating the moves according to the iterative algorithm, correctly formatting each step, and continue until the output is truncated by token limits, ensuring that the initial moves are correct and the pattern is maintained.
