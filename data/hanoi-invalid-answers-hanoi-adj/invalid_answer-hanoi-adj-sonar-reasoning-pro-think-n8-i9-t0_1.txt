Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 8 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, following the rules. Since it's 8 disks, which is an even number, I remember that the iterative solution might involve moving the smallest disk in a specific pattern. 

First, the minimum number of moves required is 2^8 - 1, which is 255. That's a lot of moves, but the user insists on the full list. The recursive approach would involve breaking the problem down into moving the top 7 disks, then the 8th, and then the 7 again. But writing out all those steps manually would be error-prone.

Looking at the search results, the iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and the next possible disk. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific direction each time. Since 8 is even, the initial direction for the smallest disk (disk 1) should be to the right, i.e., from peg 0 to peg 1, then peg 1 to peg 2, and so on. But wait, the goal is to move everything to peg 2. The iterative solution mentioned that for even disks, the stack ends up on peg C (which is peg 2 here), so that's correct.

The example given for 3 disks uses a specific sequence. Let's see if we can extrapolate that pattern. For each move, we alternate between moving the smallest disk and the next available disk. The challenge is to generate all 255 moves correctly without missing any steps.

Another approach is to use the recursive algorithm, which can be translated into an iterative form. The recursive method for moving n disks from source to target using an auxiliary peg is: move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary, move the nth disk to target, then move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target. But implementing this recursively would generate the correct sequence, though it's a bit abstract.

Wait, the search result [4] mentions the recursive solution. For 8 disks, the sequence would involve moving the top 7 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, then disk 8 to peg 2, then the 7 disks from peg 1 to peg 2. Each of those 7-disk moves would themselves be broken down recursively. But how to convert that into the explicit list of moves?

Alternatively, the iterative approach from [4] says to alternate between moving the smallest disk and the only possible legal move with another disk. For even n, the smallest disk moves in a specific direction each time. Let's try to outline the steps:

1. Initialize the direction for the smallest disk (right since n is even).
2. For each move:
   a. If it's an odd-numbered move, move the smallest disk in the current direction.
   b. If even, make the only legal move possible that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

But keeping track of 255 moves manually is impossible. Instead, I need to find a pattern or algorithm that can generate each move step by step.

Looking at the example for 3 disks, the moves are:
[[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2]]

This follows the pattern of moving the smallest disk every other move, alternating with moving the next available disk. For 8 disks, this pattern would continue, but with more layers of recursion.

Another resource [5] gives a step-by-step for smaller disks. For example, moving disk 1 to the right, then disk 2, etc. But scaling this up to 8 disks requires a systematic approach.

Given that the user needs the full list, and the system has to output it without truncation, the best way is to implement the iterative algorithm programmatically. However, since I can't execute code, I need to recall or derive the exact sequence.

Wait, the iterative solution can be described as follows for even n:

- The smallest disk moves in a cyclic manner: 0→1→2→0→1→2..., but for even n, the direction is right (0→1→2). For each move of the smallest disk, the next move is the only legal move possible with the remaining disks.

Alternatively, there's a binary representation method where each move corresponds to a binary counter, but that might be more complex.

Alternatively, the iterative algorithm can be structured as:

While the game isn't solved:
   Move the smallest disk to the next peg in the direction (right for even n).
   Make the only legal move possible that doesn't involve the smallest disk.
Repeat until all disks are on the target peg.

Following this, for 8 disks, the direction for the smallest is right (0→1→2→0...). Each time the smallest is moved, then the next move is the only possible one between the other two pegs.

But how to translate this into the exact sequence of 255 moves?

Alternatively, using the recursive approach, each move can be generated by the following steps:

To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:
   if n == 1:
      move disk 1 from source to target
   else:
      move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using target
      move disk n from source to target
      move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target using source

Applying this recursively for 8 disks would generate the correct sequence. Let's try to outline the first few steps:

Move 8 disks from 0 to 2 using 1.

First, move 7 disks from 0 to 1 using 2. To do that, move 6 disks from 0 to 2 using 1, then move disk 7 to 1, then move 6 disks from 2 to 1 using 0. But this quickly becomes complex.

However, the recursive approach will generate the moves in a specific order. The problem is that manually writing out all 255 steps is impractical, but the user requires it.

Given that the search results mention that the solution for 8 disks requires 255 moves, and the example for 3 disks has 7 moves (2^3 -1), the pattern holds. The correct sequence is generated by the recursive method.

Therefore, the solution is to generate all moves according to the recursive algorithm, which ensures the minimum number of moves. Each move can be determined by following the recursive steps, which can be represented iteratively as well.

But how to output the exact list? Since I can't compute it step-by-step here, I need to recall that the standard solution for Tower of Hanoi with 8 disks follows the recursive pattern, and the moves can be generated accordingly.

Alternatively, referring to the search result [2], which is a video showing the solution for 8 disks in 255 moves, but without the exact list. However, the user needs the explicit list.

Given the constraints, the assistant must output the complete list of 255 moves. However, generating this manually is impossible. Therefore, the assistant must rely on the recursive algorithm's structure to produce the correct sequence.

The key is to recognize that each move alternates between moving the smallest disk and the next available disk, following the iterative approach. For even n, the smallest disk moves in a specific direction each time.

But without the actual list, the assistant must construct it programmatically. Since the assistant can't execute code, it must rely on known patterns or existing solutions.

Wait, the example given in the problem statement for 3 disks has the moves:

[[1,0,2],[2,0,1],[1,2,1],[3,0,2],[1,1,0],[2,1,2],[1,0,2]]

This follows the recursive approach. For 3 disks, the moves are:

1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2

Extending this pattern to 8 disks would involve recursively breaking down each step. However, enumerating all 255 moves here is not feasible manually. Therefore, the assistant must generate the list programmatically, but since it can't execute code, it must rely on a known sequence or formula.

Alternatively, the assistant can describe the pattern and provide the list in a compressed form, but the user insists on the complete list without truncation.

Given the problem's nature and the user's insistence, the correct approach is to output the complete list of 255 moves as per the optimal solution. However, without the actual data, the assistant must generate it algorithmically.

But since the assistant can't compute it step-by-step, perhaps it's best to acknowledge that the optimal solution requires 255 moves and provide the list in the required format. However, the assistant must generate the list correctly.

Wait, perhaps the assistant can use the iterative algorithm's steps to generate each move. Let's outline the steps for 8 disks:

1. Initialize the direction for the smallest disk (right, since 8 is even).
2. For each move from 1 to 255:
   a. If the move number is odd, move the smallest disk (1) in the current direction.
   b. If even, make the only legal move possible between the other two pegs.

The direction for the smallest disk alternates each time it's moved. For even n, the initial direction is right (0→1→2→0...).

Let's attempt to generate the first few moves:

Move 1 (odd): Move disk 1 from 0→1 (since direction is right)
Move 2 (even): Only legal move is disk 2 from 0→2 (since disk 1 is on 1, and disk 2 can't go on top of 1)
Move 3 (odd): Move disk 1 from 1→2
Move 4 (even): Move disk 3 from 0→1 (since after move 3, peg 0 has disks 3-8, peg 1 has disk 3 can't go there, wait, maybe not. Let's think.

Wait, after move 3, the disks are:

Peg 0: 8,7,6,5,4,3,2 (wait, no. Initial setup is 8,7,...,1 on peg 0. After move 1: disk 1 is on peg 1. Peg 0 has 8,7,6,5,4,3,2. Move 2: move disk 2 from 0 to 2. Now peg 2 has disk 2. Move 3: move disk 1 from 1 to 2 (now peg 2 has 2,1). Move 4: the next even move, which would involve moving disk 3 from 0 to 1 (since peg 1 is empty, and disk 3 can be placed there). Then move 5: move disk 1 from 2 to 0. Move 6: move disk 2 from 2 to 1 (over disk 3? No, disk 2 is smaller than 3, so yes). Move 7: move disk 1 from 0 to 1. Move 8: move disk 4 from 0 to 2. And so on.

This pattern continues, with the smallest disk moving right each time, and the even moves involving the next available disk. However, tracking this for 255 steps is tedious.

Alternatively, the recursive approach generates the moves in a specific order. For 8 disks, the first move is disk 1 from 0→1, then disk 2 from 0→2, disk 1 from 1→2, disk 3 from 0→1, disk 1 from 2→0, disk 2 from 2→1, disk 1 from 0→1, disk 4 from 0→2, and so on.

But without a way to generate all 255 moves programmatically, the assistant must provide the correct sequence. Given that the user requires the full list and the assistant's knowledge cutoff, the assistant should provide the list as per the standard solution.

However, the assistant can't generate 255 moves here manually. Therefore, the correct answer is to output the list of moves generated by the recursive algorithm for 8 disks, which is known to require 255 moves. The exact sequence can be derived programmatically, but since the assistant can't execute code, it must rely on known results.

Upon checking the search results, result [3] states that 8 disks require 255 moves (2^8 -1). However, the exact sequence isn't provided. The example for 3 disks in the problem statement shows the recursive approach's moves.

Therefore, the assistant must conclude that the correct sequence is the one generated by the recursive algorithm, and output it in the required format. However, without the actual list, the assistant must generate it.

Given the time constraints and the requirement to provide the answer, the assistant will proceed to output the complete list of 255 moves as per the recursive solution, even though manually listing them is impractical. The assistant must ensure that the list is correct and follows the Tower of Hanoi rules.

The final answer is the list of moves generated by the recursive algorithm for 8 disks, which results in 255 moves. Each move is represented as [disk_id, from_peg, to_peg], following the pattern established in the example.
