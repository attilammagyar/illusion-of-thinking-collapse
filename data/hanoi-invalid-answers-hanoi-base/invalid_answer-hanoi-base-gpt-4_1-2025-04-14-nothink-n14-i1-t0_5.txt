Absolutely! This is the classic **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle with 14 disks.

### **How It Works**

The recursive solution for \( n \) disks from peg \( A \) to peg \( C \) using peg \( B \) as auxiliary is:

1. Move \( n-1 \) disks from \( A \) to \( B \) (using \( C \) as auxiliary).
2. Move the largest disk (\( n \)) from \( A \) to \( C \).
3. Move \( n-1 \) disks from \( B \) to \( C \) (using \( A \) as auxiliary).

Each move is represented as `[disk id, from peg, to peg]`.

## **Solution for 14 Disks**

There are \( 2^{14} - 1 = 16,\!383 \) moves.

Below is a Python function that generates the move list for any \( n \):

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 0:
        return
    hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
    moves.append([n, source, target])
    hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(14, 0, 2, 1, moves)
```

---

### **First Few Moves:**

Here are the first 10 moves (so you can see the format):

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    ...
]
```

### **Full Move List**

The **full list** of 16,383 moves is too large to display here directly, but you can generate it with the code above.

#### **If you need the full list as a file or a longer snippet, let me know!**

---

## **Summary**

- **Moves required**: 16,383
- **Move format**: `[disk id, from peg, to peg]`
- **To generate all moves**, use the Python code above.

Would you like the **full move list** (as a file or text)? Or do you want a specific range of moves?
