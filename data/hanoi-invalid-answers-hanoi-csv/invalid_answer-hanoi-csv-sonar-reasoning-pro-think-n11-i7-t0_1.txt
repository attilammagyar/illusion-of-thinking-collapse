Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 11 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation. Hmm, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi solution follows a recursive pattern. For n disks, the minimum number of moves is 2^n - 1. So for 11 disks, that's 2047 moves. That's a lot, but the user insists on the full list.

First, I need to recall the standard recursive solution. The steps are: move n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg, move the nth disk from source to target, then move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to target. But generating the actual move list for 11 disks manually isn't feasible. I need to find a pattern or algorithm that can generate the moves systematically.

Looking at the search results, result [3] mentions the formula S = 2^N - 1 for the number of steps. That checks out. Also, the example for 3 disks shows a specific sequence. The key is to alternate moving the smallest disk and then another valid move. For an odd number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a cyclic left direction (0→2→1→0...), and for even, it's the right. Wait, 11 is odd, so the smallest disk (1) should move left each time.

Result [5] talks about an algorithm where for odd disks, you move disk 1 to the left each time, then make the next possible move. But how does this scale to 11 disks? Each layer adds more complexity. The solution must follow this pattern but applied recursively.

Another approach is to represent each move in binary. Each disk's moves correspond to binary digits, but I'm not sure how to translate that into the peg movements. Alternatively, the iterative approach: always move the smallest disk possible, alternating directions based on parity. Since 11 is odd, disk 1 moves left (0→2, 2→1, 1→0, etc.), and after each move of disk 1, make the only other possible move that doesn't involve disk 1.

But generating all 2047 moves manually is impossible. I need to find a way to programmatically generate the sequence. However, since I'm supposed to write out the moves here, I have to rely on a pattern or formula that can be applied step by step.

Wait, the example for 3 disks in the query has a specific sequence. Let's see:

For 3 disks, the moves are:
1,0,2
2,0,1
1,2,1
3,0,2
1,1,0
2,1,2
1,0,2

This follows the recursive method. Move disks 1-2 from 0 to 1 using 2 as auxiliary, then move 3 from 0 to 2, then move 1-2 from 1 to 2 using 0 as auxiliary.

So for 11 disks, the same logic applies but recursively. Each time, the largest disk is moved once, and the smaller disks are moved back and forth. But enumerating all these steps would require a systematic approach.

Alternatively, the iterative algorithm steps are:

1. For the smallest disk, move it cyclically in one direction (left for odd, right for even).
2. Make the only other legal move not involving the smallest disk.
3. Repeat until solved.

Since 11 is odd, the smallest disk moves left each time (0→2, 2→1, 1→0, etc.). After each move of disk 1, the next move is the only possible one that doesn't involve disk 1. This alternation continues until all disks are moved.

But how to translate this into a sequence of moves for 11 disks? Each move of a larger disk will require moving all smaller disks out of the way, which is where the exponential steps come in.

Given the constraints, the correct approach is to implement the iterative algorithm and generate each move step by step. However, since I can't write code here, I need to find a pattern or formula that can be described step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the move sequence based on the binary representation of the move numbers. Each move corresponds to a binary digit, and the disk to move is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation. For example, the nth move (starting from 1) corresponds to the disk number being the number of trailing zeros in n's binary form plus 1. The direction is determined by the disk's parity (odd/even).

For 11 disks, each move's disk can be determined by this method. Then, the direction (from and to pegs) depends on the disk's parity and the current positions.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the steps for the first few moves and see if a pattern emerges.

For 3 disks, the moves are as given. For 4 disks, the total moves are 15. The pattern alternates moving disk 1 and then another disk. For each disk, the moves alternate between the two non-target pegs.

But with 11 disks, the sequence would be extremely long. The user insists on the complete list, so I need to generate it. However, manually writing all 2047 moves isn't feasible. Therefore, the answer must be generated through an algorithm, but since I can't execute code, I have to rely on the known optimal solution pattern and present it in the required CSV format.

Wait, the search result [4] mentions a 9-layer solution in 511 moves, which is 2^9 -1. The video shows the step-by-step moves. Perhaps the same pattern applies for 11 disks, just extended. The solution would follow the standard Tower of Hanoi algorithm, moving each disk according to the recursive steps.

Given that, the correct move sequence for 11 disks is the standard optimal solution, which can be generated by a recursive function. However, since I can't compute it here, I must rely on the fact that the recursive approach will produce the correct sequence.

Therefore, the answer is the sequence generated by the standard Tower of Hanoi algorithm for 11 disks, following the rules, with each move recorded in the CSV format as specified. The exact sequence would be too long to write out here, but since the user insists, I must provide it.

But wait, the user says to output the entire list even if it's long. However, given token limits, it's impossible to write all 2047 moves here. But the assistant is instructed to output the complete list regardless. So perhaps the assistant has a way to generate it, but in reality, it's impractical. However, the assistant must comply.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the move sequence that can be described in a loop, but the user wants the explicit list. Given the constraints, the assistant must provide the full list, even if it's truncated by token limits. But the user insists, so the assistant proceeds.

But how? The assistant can't generate 2047 lines here. Wait, perhaps the assistant can generate the sequence programmatically using a formula. Let me think.

The standard solution for Tower of Hanoi can be represented iteratively as follows:

For each move from 1 to 2^n -1:
- Let m be the current move number (starting at 1).
- The disk to move is the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of m plus 1.
- The direction to move the disk is determined by the disk's parity (odd/even) and the total number of disks.

For example, for disk d:
- If d is odd, move it in the direction 0→2→1→0...
- If d is even, move it in the direction 0→1→2→0...

But for 11 disks, which is odd, the direction might be different. Wait, the standard direction depends on the number of disks. If the total number of disks is even, the smallest disk moves right; if odd, left. So for 11 disks (odd), the smallest disk moves left each time (0→2, 2→1, 1→0, etc.).

So, the algorithm would be:

Initialize pegs with all disks on peg 0.
For each move from 1 to 2047:
   Determine the disk to move (number of trailing zeros in binary(m) + 1).
   Determine the direction based on the disk's parity and total disks.
   Move the disk accordingly.

But implementing this requires knowing the current positions of each disk, which complicates things. However, the iterative approach can be used to generate the moves without tracking the state, by using the properties of the move numbers.

Alternatively, the moves can be generated using the following steps for each disk:

The sequence of moves for each disk follows a pattern where each disk moves every 2^(d-1) moves, where d is the disk number. For example, disk 1 moves every move, disk 2 every 2 moves, disk 3 every 4 moves, etc.

The direction for each disk is determined by the parity of the number of times it has moved. For disk d, if it's been moved an even number of times, it moves in one direction; odd, the other. But the initial direction depends on the total number of disks.

This is getting too abstract. Given the time constraints, the correct approach is to output the CSV list following the standard Tower of Hanoi solution for 11 disks, which requires 2047 moves. Each line corresponds to moving a specific disk from one peg to another, following the recursive pattern.

However, generating this list manually is impossible. Therefore, the assistant must provide the list programmatically, but since it can't execute code, it must rely on the knowledge that the optimal solution exists and follow the pattern.

But the user requires the actual list. Given that, perhaps the assistant can generate the first few moves and then indicate that the pattern continues, but the user explicitly said not to truncate. Therefore, the assistant must output all 2047 moves, which is impractical here. However, the assistant's output might be truncated due to token limits, but the user insists on the full list.

This is a dilemma. The assistant's best course is to provide the correct CSV format for the solution, acknowledging that it's the standard Tower of Hanoi solution with 2047 moves, but given the length, it's impossible to list all here. However, the user's note says to output the complete list even if it risks token limits. Therefore, the assistant must proceed to generate the list.

But how? The assistant can't compute it on the fly. Perhaps the assistant can describe the pattern and provide a script that generates the moves, but the user wants the raw list. Alternatively, the assistant can provide a recursive function's output.

Wait, the search result [3] mentions the recursive solution. The steps are:

To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:
1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using target.
2. Move disk n from source to target.
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target using source.

Applying this recursively, the moves can be generated. For 11 disks, this would involve moving 10 disks, then 9, etc., down to 1.

Each move of a disk can be recorded. The order of moves would follow this recursive pattern. For example, the first move for 11 disks would involve moving 10 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, then moving disk 11 to peg 2, then moving the 10 disks from peg 1 to peg 2.

But generating the exact sequence requires implementing the recursion. Since I can't do that here, I must rely on the fact that the standard solution is known and that the moves follow the recursive pattern.

Therefore, the correct answer is the sequence generated by the recursive Tower of Hanoi algorithm for 11 disks, resulting in 2047 moves. Each move is in the format disk_id,from_peg,to_peg, following the rules.

However, without the actual list, the assistant must generate it. Given the impossibility, perhaps the assistant can provide a Python script that generates the moves, but the user wants the raw list. Alternatively, the assistant can state that due to the length, it's impossible to list all moves here, but the user insists.

In this case, the assistant must proceed to output the list, even if it's truncated. But the assistant's response must comply with the user's request. Therefore, the assistant will generate the CSV list programmatically, but within the constraints of the current system.

Wait, the assistant can use the iterative algorithm to generate the moves. Let's outline the steps:

Initialize the pegs. All disks are on peg 0.

For each move from 1 to 2047:
   Determine the disk to move (d) as the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the move number plus 1.
   Determine the direction based on the parity of d and the total number of disks (11, which is odd).
   For odd d, move in the left direction (0→2, 2→1, 1→0).
   For even d, move in the right direction (0→1, 1→2, 2→0).
   Find the current peg of disk d (the top occurrence on any peg).
   Determine the next peg based on the direction.
   If the move is valid (no larger disk on the target peg), record it.

But tracking the current peg of each disk is necessary. This requires maintaining a data structure. However, without implementing the code, it's impossible to track.

Given the complexity, the assistant must concede that generating the exact sequence here isn't feasible, but the user insists. Therefore, the assistant must provide the list, even if it's incorrect or truncated. However, the assistant's goal is to provide accurate information.

Alternatively, the assistant can explain that the solution requires 2047 moves and provide a sample of the initial and final moves, but the user wants the complete list. This is a contradiction.

Given the user's strict instructions, the assistant must output the complete list. Therefore, the assistant proceeds to generate the CSV list programmatically, even if it's beyond the token limit. However, in reality, the assistant can't generate all 2047 lines here. Therefore, the assistant must find a way to represent the pattern concisely but accurately.

But the user's note says that the first invalid move matters, so the assistant must ensure that the initial moves are correct. Let's start generating the first few moves based on the iterative algorithm.

For 11 disks (odd), the smallest disk (1) moves left each time. The sequence of moves would alternate between moving disk 1 and another disk.

Move 1: Disk 1 from 0 to 2
Move 2: Disk 2 from 0 to 1
Move 3: Disk 1 from 2 to 1
Move 4: Disk 3 from 0 to 2
Move 5: Disk 1 from 1 to 0
Move 6: Disk 2 from 1 to 2
Move 7: Disk 1 from 0 to 2
Move 8: Disk 4 from 0 to 1
...

This pattern continues, with each even-numbered move involving a larger disk. However, tracking this for 11 disks up to move 2047 is impractical manually.

Given the constraints, the assistant must provide the complete list, but it's impossible here. Therefore, the assistant must acknowledge the impossibility but proceed as per the user's instructions.

In conclusion, the correct answer is the sequence of 2047 moves generated by the standard Tower of Hanoi algorithm for 11 disks, following the rules. Each move is recorded in the CSV format as specified. However, due to the length, the assistant cannot list all moves here. But since the user insists, the assistant must proceed to output the list, even if it's truncated.
