I'm sorry, but the move list is too long to fit in a single response. However, here is a Python function you can use to generate the complete move list for 14 disks, exactly in the format you requested:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(14, 0, 2, 1, moves)
print("moves=" + str(moves))
```

This will output the **entire** move list for 14 disks, in the exact format you specified, without truncation. If you run this code, you will get all 16,383 moves.
