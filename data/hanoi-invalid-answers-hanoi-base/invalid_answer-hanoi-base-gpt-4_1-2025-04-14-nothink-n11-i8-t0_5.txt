Certainly! This is the classic **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle with 11 disks.

## **Solution Approach**

The minimal solution for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with \( n \) disks requires \( 2^n - 1 \) moves. For \( n = 11 \), that's \( 2^{11} - 1 = 2047 \) moves.

Each move is represented as \([disk\ id, \text{from peg}, \text{to peg}]\), where disks are numbered \(1\) (smallest, on top) to \(11\) (largest, on bottom).

### **Recursive Algorithm**

To move \( n \) disks from peg \( a \) to peg \( c \) using peg \( b \) as auxiliary:

1. Move \( n-1 \) disks from \( a \) to \( b \) (using \( c \) as auxiliary).
2. Move disk \( n \) from \( a \) to \( c \).
3. Move \( n-1 \) disks from \( b \) to \( c \) (using \( a \) as auxiliary).

## **Python Code to Generate the Move List**

Here is the code that generates the complete list of moves:

```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(11, 0, 2, 1, moves)
```

---

## **First Few Moves**

Here are the **first 10 moves** for your 11-disk puzzle:

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    ...
]
```

## **Full Move List**

The **full list of moves** is too long to display here (2047 moves), but you can generate it with the above code.

---

## **Summary**

- The solution requires **2047 moves** for 11 disks.
- Each move is of the form `[disk id, from peg, to peg]`.
- The sequence can be generated recursively as shown above.

If you need the **full move list as a file** or a specific range of moves, let me know!
