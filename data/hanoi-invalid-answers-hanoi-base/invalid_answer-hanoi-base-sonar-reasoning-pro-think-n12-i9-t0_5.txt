Okay, I need to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for 12 disks. Let me start by recalling the standard solution. The Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive problem. The minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, which for 12 disks would be 4095 moves. That's a lot!

First, the recursive approach: To move n disks from peg A to peg C, you move n-1 disks from A to B, then move the nth disk from A to C, and then move the n-1 disks from B to C. But generating the actual move list for 12 disks manually would be impractical. However, maybe there's an iterative method mentioned in the search results.

Looking at the search results, result [2] mentions an iterative solution. The steps involve alternating between moving the smallest disk and making the only legal move with a non-smallest disk. The direction to move the smallest disk depends on whether the number of disks is even or odd. Since we have 12 disks (even), the smallest disk should move in a specific direction each time.

From the iterative solution description: For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a fixed direction, say right (peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0...). Each time, after moving the smallest, the next move is the only legal move possible with the remaining disks. This pattern repeats until all disks are on the target peg.

But how to translate this into a sequence of moves? Let's think step by step for smaller numbers and see the pattern.

For 3 disks, the solution is 7 moves. The example given in the problem statement has moves like moving disk 1 from peg 0 to 2, then disk 2 from 0 to 1, etc. The iterative method for even n (like 12) would have the smallest disk moving right (0→1→2→0...) each time. Each move of the smallest is followed by the only possible non-smallest move.

But generating all 4095 moves manually isn't feasible. Instead, I need to find an algorithm that can generate the moves programmatically. However, since the user is asking for the complete list, perhaps there's a pattern or a way to represent it.

Wait, the problem statement example uses a specific format for moves: each move is [disk, from, to]. For 3 disks, the solution provided has 7 moves. Let's see if there's a pattern in the order of disk movements.

Alternatively, the recursive approach can be used to generate the moves. For 12 disks, the sequence would be:

1. Move disks 1-11 from peg 0 to peg 1.
2. Move disk 12 from peg 0 to peg 2.
3. Move disks 1-11 from peg 1 to peg 2.

Each of these steps involves recursion. Each time, the moves for the smaller disks are generated by the same method. But again, writing out all 4095 moves here is impossible. However, the user might expect the correct sequence following the iterative method's rules.

Another approach is to use the binary representation of the move numbers. Each move corresponds to a bit in the binary count, where the position of the bit determines which disk to move. But I'm not sure how that translates to actual disk numbers.

Alternatively, the iterative solution's steps can be codified. For each move:

- If the move number is odd, move the smallest disk (disk 1) in the predetermined direction (for even n, to the right: 0→1, 1→2, 2→0).
- If the move number is even, make the only legal move possible that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

This would generate the correct sequence. Let's test this with the 3-disk example. The moves are:

1. Move 1 from 0→2 (odd move 1)
2. Move 2 from 0→1 (even move 2)
3. Move 1 from 2→1 (odd move 3)
4. Move 3 from 0→2 (even move 4)
5. Move 1 from 1→0 (odd move 5)
6. Move 2 from 1→2 (even move 6)
7. Move 1 from 0→2 (odd move 7)

This matches the example provided. So for 12 disks, following the same pattern:

- Since 12 is even, the smallest disk (1) moves right each time (0→1→2→0...).
- After each move of disk 1, the next move is the only legal move possible with the remaining disks.

But how to generate all these moves? It's a systematic process but requires tracking each disk's position. Since manually listing 4095 moves isn't feasible, perhaps the answer expects the recognition that the minimal number of moves is 4095 and the pattern follows the iterative method, but the actual list is too long to present here. However, the user specifically asked for the complete list of moves in the required format.

Wait, the problem statement's example for 3 disks includes the full move list. The user might expect a similar full list for 12 disks, but that's impractical. However, the search results mention that the minimum number of moves is 2^12 -1 = 4095. So the answer must include the complete list of 4095 moves. But how?

This is a contradiction. The user can't expect a 4095-line answer here. Maybe the answer is to provide the recursive method to generate the moves, but the user wants the actual sequence. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is to state that the sequence is too long to list here but can be generated using the recursive or iterative method, and provide an example of the first few and last few moves.

But the problem's requirements state: "Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]".

Given that, the assistant must provide the full list. However, generating that here is impossible due to length. Therefore, perhaps the answer is to provide the algorithm and explain that the list follows the iterative method, but the actual list is too lengthy. However, the user's query insists on the complete list. 

Wait, maybe the user is testing the assistant's ability to generate the correct algorithm, not the actual list. But the problem says "Find the sequence of moves". Given the constraints, perhaps the assistant should outline the method to generate the moves and provide a sample, acknowledging the length.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the disk movements. For example, each disk moves in a specific pattern. Disk 1 moves every other move, disk 2 every 4th move, etc. But how to map that.

Alternatively, using the recursive approach, the moves can be generated as follows:

To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:

1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.
2. Move disk n from source to target.
3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target.

Each of these steps is recursive. For 12 disks, this would generate the correct sequence. But again, the actual list is too long.

Given that, perhaps the answer is to present the recursive algorithm in code that can generate the moves, but the user wants the actual list. Since it's impossible to write out 4095 moves here, maybe the answer should state that the complete list is too long but can be generated using the following method, and provide a code snippet.

But the user's query specifically asks for the sequence of moves. The example given for 3 disks includes the full list. Therefore, the assistant must provide the full list for 12 disks. However, this is impractical. 

Wait, perhaps the assistant can provide the code that generates the moves, and the user can run it to get the list. But the problem requires the list in the answer. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mathematical way to represent the moves. Each move corresponds to a specific disk and direction based on the move number. For example, the disk to move is determined by the number of times the move number is divisible by 2, plus 1. Then, the direction is determined by the disk's parity and the total number of disks.

But I'm not sure. Let me check the search results again. Result [2] mentions the iterative solution: alternate between moving the smallest piece and a non-smallest piece. For even n, the smallest moves in a fixed direction. The non-smallest move is the only legal one.

Therefore, the algorithm is:

Initialize pegs with all disks on peg 0.

While not all disks are on peg 2:

1. Move the smallest disk (disk 1) to the next peg in the direction (right for even n).
2. Make the only legal move possible that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

Repeat until done.

Each iteration of these two steps progresses the solution. For 12 disks, this would take 4095 moves.

But to generate the exact list, one would need to simulate each move. Since I can't simulate 4095 moves here, perhaps the answer is to provide the code that generates the moves, using the iterative approach.

The user might accept a code snippet that, when run, produces the move list. Let me check the query's requirements: the answer must include the complete list of moves in the specified format. Therefore, the assistant must provide the list, but it's impossible here. 

This suggests that there's a misunderstanding. Perhaps the user expects the assistant to recognize that the list is too long and instead provide the method to generate it, along with a sample. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can provide a condensed version, showing the pattern and the total number of moves.

But the problem's example for 3 disks includes the full 7 moves, so perhaps the assistant is expected to generate the full list regardless of length. However, in reality, that's not feasible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem setup, or the assistant should explain the impossibility and provide the method.

Given the constraints, the assistant should outline the method and state that the complete list can be generated using the iterative or recursive approach, and provide an example of the first few moves and the last few moves, along with the total count. However, the user's requirements explicitly demand the complete list. 

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can provide a mathematical formula or a generator function. But the answer must be in the specified format.

Wait, looking back at the search results, result [2] provides an iterative solution. Let me check the exact steps:

"For an even number of disks, make the legal move between pegs A and B (in either direction), then between A and C, then between B and C, repeating until complete."

Wait, the iterative solution mentioned in [2] says:

The iterative solution is equivalent to repeated execution of the following sequence until the goal is achieved:

- Move between A and B
- Move between A and C
- Move between B and C

But how does that translate to actual disk moves?

Alternatively, the solution involves moving the smallest disk every other move, and the direction depends on the parity of the number of disks. For even n, the smallest moves right (0→1→2→0...), for odd n, left (0→2→1→0...).

Each move of the smallest is followed by the only possible non-smallest move. This pattern repeats.

Therefore, for 12 disks (even), the smallest moves right each time. The sequence would start as:

Move 1: disk 1 from 0→1

Then the only legal non-smallest move (disk 2 can't move yet, so maybe disk 2 from 0→2?)

Wait, after moving disk 1 to peg 1, the next move is the only legal move not involving disk 1. The pegs are:

Peg 0: 12,11,...,2

Peg 1: 1

Peg 2: empty

The only possible move is disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.

Then move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.

Then move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1.

And so on.

This pattern continues, with the smallest disk moving right each time, and the other moves being determined by the only legal option.

But to generate all 4095 moves, one would need to simulate each step. Since I can't do that here, the answer must acknowledge that the list is too long but provide the method and perhaps a code snippet to generate it.

Given the user's requirements, the correct answer is to provide the complete list, but that's impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction. However, considering the example provided for 3 disks, which has 7 moves, the assistant must generate the list programmatically. 

Perhaps the answer should include a Python function that generates the moves, and then the user can run it to get the list. Let me check the search results again. Result [5] mentions a recursive visualization, which implies a recursive approach.

Here's a Python function using recursion to generate the moves:

def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
tower_of_hanoi(12, 0, 2, 1, moves)
print(moves)

This code would generate the move list for 12 disks. However, the moves for the smaller disks are intertwined with the larger ones. For example, moving 12 disks requires moving 11 disks twice, each of which requires moving 10 disks twice, etc.

The resulting moves list would have 4095 entries. The assistant can't list them all here, but can provide the code and explain that running it generates the correct sequence.

However, the user's query explicitly asks for the sequence of moves in the specified format. Since including all 4095 moves is impractical, the answer must explain this and provide the code to generate them.

Therefore, the final answer should outline the recursive method, provide the code, and state that the move list can be generated by executing the code, resulting in 4095 moves following the correct sequence.

The Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 12 disks requires 4095 moves to solve optimally. The solution follows a recursive pattern where smaller disks are repeatedly moved to auxiliary pegs to allow larger disks to reach the target. Here's the sequence generation method and key steps:

**Recursive Algorithm**  
The moves can be generated using this Python function:
```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(12, 0, 2, 1, moves)
```

**Key Pattern**  
1. First 2047 moves: Transfer disks 1-11 from peg 0 → peg 1
2. Move 2048: Transfer disk 12 from peg 0 → peg 2
3. Final 2047 moves: Transfer disks 1-11 from peg 1 → peg 2

**First 5 Moves**  
```
[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0]
```

**Last 5 Moves**  
```
[1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]
```

The complete 4095-move sequence follows strict mathematical rules where each disk moves exactly \(2^{12-k}\) times (for disk \(k\)), following the pattern:
\[ \text{Moves}(n) = 2\cdot\text{Moves}(n-1) + 1 \]

Full solution requires executing the algorithm to generate all moves. The minimal solution is proven optimal by the formula \(2^{12} - 1 = 4095\)[2].
