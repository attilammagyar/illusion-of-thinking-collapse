Okay, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 14 disks. The user wants the complete list of moves without any truncation. Hmm, the Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive problem, but generating all the moves for 14 disks manually would be impossible. Wait, the minimum number of moves required is 2^14 - 1, which is 16383 moves. That's a lot! But the user insists on the full list, so I need to find a way to generate it programmatically.

First, I remember that the recursive solution involves moving n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, then moving the nth disk to the target peg, and then moving the n-1 disks onto the target peg. But for an iterative approach, maybe there's a pattern. The search results mention an iterative solution where you alternate moves between the smallest disk and a non-smallest disk. For even numbers of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific direction each time.

Looking at the example with 3 disks, the solution had 7 moves. The iterative approach for even n (like 14) would involve moving the smallest disk in a particular direction each time. The Wikipedia article says that for an even number of disks, the stack ends up on peg C (which is peg 2 in this case), which matches the goal here.

The key points from the sources:
- The minimum moves are 2^n - 1. For 14 disks, that's 16383 moves.
- The iterative solution alternates between moving the smallest disk and the next possible move.
- For even n, the smallest disk moves in a specific direction (right, perhaps), and the non-smallest moves are determined by legality.

But how to generate each move step-by-step? The iterative algorithm from the sources says:
1. Move the smallest disk to the next peg in a fixed direction (right for even n).
2. Make the only legal move possible that doesn't involve the smallest disk.

Repeating these steps until all disks are moved. Since 14 is even, the initial direction for the smallest disk (disk 1) is to the right (peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0, etc.).

But generating all 16383 moves manually isn't feasible. However, the user expects the complete list. Since I can't output all due to token limits, but the user insists, maybe the system has a way to handle large outputs. Wait, the personalization section says to output the entire list even if it's long. So I need to generate it correctly.

But how? The recursive approach can be converted into an iterative one. Let's outline the steps:

For each move from 1 to 16383:
- If the move number is odd, move the smallest disk (disk 1) in the predetermined direction (for even n, direction is right, so peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0...).
- If the move number is even, make the only legal move possible between the other two pegs.

Wait, the iterative solution's steps are:
- Alternate between moving the smallest disk and the next legal move. The direction of the smallest disk depends on whether n is even or odd. Since n=14 is even, the direction is to the right (peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0...).

So for each odd-numbered move (1st, 3rd, 5th...), move disk 1 to the next peg in the direction. For even moves, move the next possible disk between the other two pegs.

But how to determine the direction for the smallest disk? The sources mention that for even n, the smallest moves to the right. So starting at peg 0, first move to peg 1, then peg 2, then peg 0, etc.

Now, to generate each move:

Initialize pegs as [ [14,13,...,1], [], [] ]

For move_number in 1 to 16383:
   if move_number is odd:
      move disk 1 from current peg to next peg in direction (right for even n)
   else:
      find the two pegs that don't have disk 1, and make the legal move between them (the smaller disk on top of the larger one)

But tracking the position of disk 1 each time. Let's see:

Move 1 (odd): move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.
Move 2 (even): move the smallest possible disk between peg 0 and peg 2. Since peg 0 has 14,13,...2 and peg 2 is empty, move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.
Move 3 (odd): move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.
Move 4 (even): move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1 (since peg 0's top is 3, and peg 1 is empty or has larger disk)
Wait, but after move 3, peg 0 has 14-3, peg 1 has 2, and peg 2 has 1. So move 4 would involve moving the next available disk. The non-1 disks are on peg 0 (top 3) and peg 1 (top 2). The legal move is to move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0 (since 2 < 3). Wait, but peg 0's top is 3, so placing 2 on top is allowed. Wait, no: peg 1 has disk 2, and peg 0 has disk 3. So moving disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0 would place it on top of 3, which is allowed. But that's not correct because in the standard solution, after moving disk 1 to peg 2, the next move is to move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, the even moves involve the two pegs that don't have disk 1. So after move 1, disk 1 is on peg 1. The other pegs are 0 and 2. The legal move between them is to move the smaller top disk. Peg 0 has 14-2, top is 2. Peg 2 is empty. So move 2 is moving disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2.

Then move 3: disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2.

Move 4: now, the non-1 pegs are 0 and 1. Peg 0 has 14-3, top is 3. Peg 1 is empty. So move 3 from peg 0 to peg 1.

Move 5: disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0.

Move 6: non-1 pegs are 1 and 2. Peg 1 has 3, peg 2 has 2. So move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1 (on top of 3).

Move 7: disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1.

Move 8: move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2.

And so on. This pattern continues, with the smallest disk moving right each odd move, and the even moves moving the next possible disk between the other two pegs.

But generating all 16383 moves step-by-step is tedious. However, the user requires the complete list. Since I can't write all here due to length, but the system might have a way to output it, I need to generate the correct sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula to determine each move. The Tower of Hanoi has a binary solution where each move corresponds to a bit in a binary counter. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: the iterative algorithm can be implemented with the following steps:

1. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves right (peg 0 → peg 1 → peg 2 → peg 0...).
2. For each move:
   a. If it's an odd move, move the smallest disk in the current direction.
   b. If it's even, make the only legal move possible between the other two pegs.

So, to generate the list, I can simulate each move:

Initialize pegs as [[14,13,...,1], [], []]
direction = right (since n=14 is even)
current_peg_1 = 0 (starting position of disk 1)

For each move_number from 1 to 16383:
   if move_number is odd:
      next_peg = (current_peg_1 + 1) % 3
      move disk 1 from current_peg_1 to next_peg
      current_peg_1 = next_peg
   else:
      find the two pegs not containing disk 1 (peg_a and peg_b)
      top_a = top disk of peg_a
      top_b = top disk of peg_b
      if top_a < top_b or peg_b is empty:
          move top_a from peg_a to peg_b
      else:
          move top_b from peg_b to peg_a

But simulating this for 14 disks would require tracking all pegs' states, which is complex. However, the user wants the complete list. Given the constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to output the iterative solution's moves as per the algorithm, even if it's a long list.

But given the token limitations, it's impossible to list all 16383 moves here. However, the user insists, so perhaps the system allows for a very long output. Therefore, I need to generate the moves correctly.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the moves that can be represented programmatically. For example, the moves for the Tower of Hanoi can be generated using a recursive function, but again, outputting all moves would be too long.

Wait, the example given in the search results for 3 disks has 7 moves. Let's see if the pattern holds:

Move 1: 0→2 (disk 1)
Move 2: 0→1 (disk 2)
Move 3: 2→1 (disk 1)
Move 4: 0→2 (disk 3)
Move 5: 1→0 (disk 1)
Move 6: 1→2 (disk 2)
Move 7: 0→2 (disk 1)

But for n=3 (odd), the direction is left. Wait, the example in the search result [1] mentions that for even n, the first move is to the temporary peg (peg 1), but in the example with 3 disks (odd), the first move is to peg 2. Hmm, perhaps the direction depends on the parity of n.

Given that n=14 is even, the initial direction for the smallest disk is to peg 1, then peg 2, then peg 0, etc.

So the first few moves for n=14 would be:

Move 1: 0→1 (disk 1)
Move 2: 0→2 (disk 2)
Move 3: 1→2 (disk 1)
Move 4: 0→1 (disk 3)
Move 5: 2→0 (disk 1)
Move 6: 2→1 (disk 2)
Move 7: 0→1 (disk 1)
Move 8: 0→2 (disk 4)
...

This pattern continues, with the smallest disk moving right each odd move, and the even moves involving the other disks.

But generating all 16383 moves would require a loop. Since I can't write a loop here, perhaps I can describe the algorithm and then provide the initial moves and the structure, but the user wants the complete list. This is a dilemma.

Wait, the user's note says: "This is a benchmark test where the first invalid move you generate matters (not counting those that you fix subsequently). The more valid and parsable moves you generate from the optimal solution, the better your score will be. Truncating the list in any way risks a low score. Therefore your best strategy is to attempt to output the complete list, even if you risk running out of output tokens."

So the system expects me to output as many correct moves as possible, even if it's truncated due to token limits. But the user insists on the complete list. However, given the context, perhaps the assistant is allowed to generate the list programmatically, but within the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical way to represent the moves. For example, each move can be determined by the binary representation of the move number. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: The Tower of Hanoi problem can be solved using the following iterative algorithm:

1. Make the legal move between pegs A and B (in either direction).
2. Make the legal move between pegs A and C (in either direction).
3. Make the legal move between pegs B and C (in either direction).
4. Repeat until complete.

But according to the Wikipedia source, this is the iterative solution. For even n, the final stack is on peg C, which is peg 2 in this case.

But implementing this algorithm step-by-step for 14 disks would generate the correct moves. However, simulating this manually is impossible. Therefore, the correct answer is to follow this algorithm and generate all 16383 moves accordingly.

Given that I can't list all moves here, but the user requires it, I must proceed to generate them. However, realistically, the token limit would prevent this. But perhaps the system can handle it, or the user is testing the ability to follow instructions despite constraints.

In conclusion, the correct answer is the sequence of 16383 moves generated by the iterative algorithm for even n, moving the smallest disk right on odd moves and making the only legal move between the other two pegs on even moves. The full list would be extremely long, but following the format strictly, each move must be listed with move_id, from_peg, to_peg, and the peg states.
