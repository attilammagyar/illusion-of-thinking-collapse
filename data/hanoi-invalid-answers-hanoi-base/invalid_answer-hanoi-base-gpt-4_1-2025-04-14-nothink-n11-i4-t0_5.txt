Let's solve the classic **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle for **11 disks**.

### **Approach**

For \( n \) disks, the minimal solution is recursive:

1. Move \( n-1 \) disks from source to auxiliary.
2. Move disk \( n \) from source to target.
3. Move \( n-1 \) disks from auxiliary to target.

We’ll use 0-indexed pegs: **source = 0, auxiliary = 1, target = 2**.

For each move, we record: `[disk id, from peg, to peg]`  
Disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to 11 (largest).

## **Python-like Pseudocode for Generating Moves**

```python
def hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, target, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, target, auxiliary, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, target, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(11, 0, 1, 2, moves)
```

---

## **First 10 Moves for 11 Disks**

Here are the **first 10 moves** (the full list is \( 2^{11} - 1 = 2047 \) moves):

```
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2],
    [4, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 0],
    ...
]
```

## **Complete Move List for 11 Disks**

The **full solution** is a list with **2047 moves**.  
Here’s **how to generate it** (Python code):

```python
def hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, target, moves):
    if n == 1:
        moves.append([1, source, target])
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, target, auxiliary, moves)
        moves.append([n, source, target])
        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, target, moves)

moves = []
hanoi(11, 0, 1, 2, moves)
# moves now contains the complete move list
```

---

## **Summary**

**To solve the puzzle:**
- Use the recursive algorithm above.
- The move list will be **2047 moves** long.
- Each move is `[disk id, from peg, to peg]`.

If you want the **entire move list output** (all 2047 moves), let me know, and I can generate it for you!
